I've been waiting for a very long time in line at a packed grocery store, and I'm in a hurry to go home because I still have lots of work to do. I start sweating under my thick winter jacket. People bump into me from the front and back, and occasionally, somebody bisects  the line toward another cashier. I try to peek over other people's shoulders, but the line is not moving. I am uncomfortable, I feel like I'm trapped in the middle of a sea of people. I wipe sweat from my forehead and feel dizzy. I try to move a little to get more space, but the mass of other people is just pressing harder against me. My cheeks are glowing red, and I'm gasping for air. I reach to look over at other people. The line still hasn't moved, and I start to get a headache. Now I really feel like I'm trapped. Sounds fade in the background, becoming distant noise, and I know that another attack is coming. “This time, I will die,” I think to myself, in a panic.
