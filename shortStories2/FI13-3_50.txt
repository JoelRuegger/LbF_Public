I'm standing near the edge of the stage in the wings, hidden from the audience, awaiting the signal. I've been preparing my speech for months, and my time has come. The host introduces me, and I can feel the anxiety flow through my body. The audience is clapping, and I know that's my signal. My legs are shaking when I walk across the stage into the bright spotlight, which blinds me for a moment. I blink in a panic, and when my eyes adjust to the light, I can see a sea of people in front of me. Everybody is looking at me. My movements feel unnatural as I walk toward the lectern. I open my bag to get out my papers, and I sneak glimpses of the audience. They are waiting silently and stare at me. My throat is dry, and I cough. My hand stops when I realize that my papers are not in my bag. I look at my empty bag in shock, and sweat is dripping from my forehead. I've lost all my notes, pictures, everything! What am I going to do now? I look at the audience, and they are just staring back at me. They must see how Imshaking and sweating. I mumble something and laugh nervously.
