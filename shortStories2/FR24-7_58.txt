On leaving high school, all my best friends spread out to pursue studies in different places. We would meet at the weekend but one of them, LÃ©a, had moved to the UK for 6 months. As soon as we learned when she was coming back, we decided to surprise her and catch her at the station. We made a banner decorated for the occasion. When her train arrived at the station, we unfolded it and we all hid behind it. When we spotted her coming down the platform, she was looking for her parents, but as soon as she saw us and read the banner, she started to cry and hugged us one by one. The group was complete at last, and we enjoyed those two weeks as much as we could before resuming our studies.
