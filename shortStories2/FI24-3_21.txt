It's late at night when I leave to go home. Earlier in the day, I left my car in a parking garage full of cars, in the last row. Now the garage is empty and dark. I can hear only the hum of air conditioning and the buzz of strip lighting. I can see my lonely car in the far-away corner, and I feel anxious about walking through the parking garage. I know that nothing is going to happen, but I still clench my keys tightly. Walking to my car seems to take forever, and I walk faster. I just want to get to my car as quickly as possible. Suddenly, I hear steps behind me. I take a quick breath of air and feel panic rising inside me. I don't look back and speed up. I see a long shadow on my right, and I realize that somebody is following me. I turn the keys in my sweaty hands and try to take out the car key. The steps behind me are getting faster and the shadow next to me is getting longer. My heart beats fast, and I start running. I hear my stalker start running after me.
