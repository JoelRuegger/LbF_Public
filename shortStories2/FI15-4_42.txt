Plenty of moving boxes remain in my home as I sit on a chair, concentrating on unpacking a box. I'm relieved that I marked each box with the room from which the contents came. I am now unpacking kitchen boxes. I cut the tape on the box and remove items. I consider where I should place every item and put them there. The radio is on in the background, and I listen to the music absent-mindedly. I hear a phone ring somewhere, and I recognize it as mine. I cannot remember where I put my phone. In the middle of the boxes, it is hard to locate the ringing sound. I lift some boxes and look for my phone. The ringing continues as I continue looking. “Perhaps I forgot it in the pocket of my coat,” I think to myself, as I search through the boxes.
