I'm in a grocery store and push the shopping cart along the aisle. I have arrived just before rush hour, so there's no crowd or much noise. I only hear typical grocery-store noises and ads blaring from the loud speakers. I glance at my shopping list, which I wrote that morning. I already bought the ingredients for dinner earlier, so all I need on this trip is some items for the fridge. From the fruit section, I pick up some bananas and a few apples. I weigh the fruit and put it in the shopping cart. From the cold shelves, I pick up a couple of milk cartons and some yogurt. From the next shelf, I get some butter and a piece of cheese. I continue to the bread shelves, then stop to decide whether I should get my usual loaf or try some novelty bread from the bakery. I end up trying the novelty bread and put it in my shopping cart. “I should pick up some drinks for the weekend,” I think to myself as I continue.
