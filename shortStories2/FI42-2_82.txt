I work at a company that cleans rental cabins. I'm on my way to clean a cabin that the previous tenants failed to clean properly before leaving a couple of weeks ago. I have a bad feeling about this because tenants often leave these cabins in terrible shape. I arrive at the cabin, and a rotten smell hits me as I open the door. I stop and let out a long, deep breath, then close my eyes as I start to feel nauseous. I make myself step inside. I try to hold my breath as I walk into the kitchen. A trash bin has fallen to the floor, and its contents have spilled onto the floor, staining the carpet. Maggots are crawling over the leftover food. I try not to think about what the other rooms must look like. I just know that I need to clean up this mess.
