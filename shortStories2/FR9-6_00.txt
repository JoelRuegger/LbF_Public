One year â€¦ for the whole year, every day I was waiting for that moment. A whole year passed, watching all over again the beautiful pictures that my mother had taken! I had imagined that moment dozens of times. But now this was it, I finally had the chance to enjoy the evening and go to bed later than usual. That was great! I didn't know the reason, but that didn't matter. My heart seemed to beat more quickly when it became dark. Is it going to be much longer? The darker it got, the longer the minutes seemed. How miserable! Mom and Dad were there, as well as my grandparents, sitting next to me, but they didn't seem that eager, chatting peacefully. For them, the waiting wasn't hard. How unfair ... Suddenly, I heard the first firework being shot into the sky! How thrilling: this was the beginning! My eyes looked up to the sky. How wonderful these fireworks were!
