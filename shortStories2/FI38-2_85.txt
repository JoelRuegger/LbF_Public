I'm camping with my friends on a summer weekend. After hiking for an entire day, we stop for the night and set up camp beside a beautiful lake. We put up our tent in a small clearing near the woods and crawl into our sleeping bags, exhausted. It is midnight when I suddenly wake up in the darkness. It takes a while to remember where I am. I feel some movement next to my thigh and feel a shiver up my spine. I try to stay still, even though my heart is pounding, and drops of sweat appear on my forehead. I carefully look into my sleeping bag. Something moves inside it, and I blink my eyes to get used to the darkness. Slowly, my sight gets sharper, and I can see a long, shiny snake resting on my thigh. It's hissing and licking its tongue. I gasp for air, and I can no longer hold back my panic. I scream and try to get out of the sleeping bag. I feel like I'm stuck because I zipped the sleeping bag all the way to the top.
