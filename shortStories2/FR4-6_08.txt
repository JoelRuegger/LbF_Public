I was 4 or 5 years old. We lived in the countryside, a house with a big garden. In my memories, the living room was a huge, stark and cold room where we barely went, but it was December 25th! Exceptionally, the record player was out of the cupboard with the traditional LP of Christmas songs, close to the bay window. When my dad turned on the record player, we were only lacking snow to make it a real party. And while I was looking outside, glued to the window, slowly falling from the sky, huge, the first snowflakes of winter, under my amazed sight. This memory was too dear to me, too wonderful to dare to call into question. A few months ago, a few days before she died, I told this memory to my mother, having doubts about its truth. She told me then that an old uncle was at our place that day, and thanked her for giving him one of the most beautiful presents through the amazed, look of a little girl, her eyes starry.
