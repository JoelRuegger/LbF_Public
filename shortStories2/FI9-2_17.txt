I'm standing near the entrance to the train station, waiting for my friend. A couple of drunks are sitting on the stairs, and I try to become invisible so that I won't attract their attention. One of them shouts something, and I avoid looking at them. I hear grunting as one of them gets up and starts walking toward me. The pungent smell of urine and filth is distinct from afar. I move restlessly a few steps to the side, but the man is stumbling straight toward me. His face is scarred and sweaty, and his greasy hair is glued on his temples. I flinch when he grasps my sleeve. He's explaining something in a rambling way, and spit spurts out from between his yellow teeth. The smell of old sweat and booze is so strong that I turn my face away. The man is jerking at my sleeve, and I feel uncomfortable. I try to hold my breath and not show how nauseous I feel.
