It's Saturday night and time for the national lottery. The TV host is introducing the official jury when I sit down in front of the TV, as usual, with a pen and my lottery ticket to check my numbers. The machine starts, and the numbers come out one by one. I circle the numbers on my ticket and feel excited: one, two, three, four, five, and now already six correct numbers! My heart starts beating fast, and I cannot sit still due to the excitement anymore, so I stand up and run my fingers through my hair. Is this true? I'm waiting for the last number in disbelief. The last number on my ticket is 20. “Please be number 20, be 20, be 20…,” I think to myself. The last number is revealed, and it's 20. Unbelievable!  Shaking, I check all the numbers again. I hear the TV host state that there is one winning ticket. I look at my ticket, then at the TV, and I cannot believe my luck. I have just won 4 million euros! I shout out loud and jump up and down with joy.
