Even though we have been together for some time, I feel like I've just fallen in love. When we're apart, I often think of you and smile to myself. I want to share even the smallest things with you because you seem to think about everything the same way that I do. When I'm thinking of our next meeting, I feel a gnawing in my stomach. I cannot wait to see you again. When we're together, the air is filled with love. With you, I feel like I'm home. I know that we will meet today, and I've been waiting for it eagerly all day. I hear the door open, and I'm filled with tingling expectations. You step inside and take off your coat. You look at me and smile. Your smile is contagious. I get up from the sofa and walk toward you. I shiver when our bodies touch each other. I reach out my hands, and I want to touch and kiss you everywhere. You grab me, and I melt in your hands. You whisper into my ear, “I love you.”
