I sit in an open office, immersed in my work. It's a tranquil afternoon at my workplace – phones ringing every now and then, fingers tapping on keyboards, and the coffee maker  gurgling. My boss walks into the corridor and stops to say “Hi” to me. I stop working, and we chat a little. My boss mentions a previous project, which I finalized. I'm proud of my work. Suddenly, my boss smiles and offers his hand: “We've been very happy with your work.” I shake his hand, slightly puzzled. My cheeks get red, and my heart is pounding. The boss continues: “The board has decided that now would be a good time for a raise – we can talk about that in my office later today.” I can't hold back a wide smile. I tell him how much I like my job and how happy I am to be appreciated. My boss smiles, nods, and continues walking. I look around, and one of my colleagues gives me a thumbs-up, while another shouts out his congratulations. I grin happily in response, then return to work.
