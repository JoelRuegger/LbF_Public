It's time for the tennis match's defining round. I know my opponent well, and that he will not give up easily. My muscles are tired, but I'm not giving up. It's my turn to serve, and I hit the ball toward my opponent. He returns it, and for some time, we hit the ball back and forth. My opponent makes a beautiful shot on my left side, then to the right, then again to the left. I barely manage to return the ball in time. I know that I'm being led by my opponent. I need to take control quickly, or otherwise, I'll lose. Out of breath, I run to the other side of the field. This time, I was faster, and my return is not weak. With all my body weight behind this shot, I gather the remains of my strength and shoot a perfect backhand drive. The joy of a successful performance surges inside me as the racket hits the ball. I know instantly that it was a winning drive. The ball hits the opponent's field, and he cannot make it in time. I raise my fist in victory as the referee declares me the winner.
