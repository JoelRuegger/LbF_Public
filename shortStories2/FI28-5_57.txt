I'm spending an afternoon at the zoo. There's a cold wind outside, so I decide to go indoors. I check out the reptile house first, then the birds. I enter the reptile house, and tropical, humid, warm air hits my face. I look around at the terrariums, then follow the marked route. I walk along the corridors and peek into the terrariums, which contain lizards and frogs of differing colors and sizes. Every now and then, I stop for a longer time to peer through the windows because some of the reptiles are so well camouflaged that they are hard to see. The biggest terrarium is in the corner, which contains a giant snake wrapped around a tree in the shadows. The snake seems to be sleeping, and I admire its beautiful stripes and shiny scales. I'm startled when it suddenly opens its yellow eyes and looks directly at me. I step away reflexively. The snake's double-tipped tongue starts licking the air.
