I have been at the airport for a while: you're not here yet. I look around me, searching the space, hoping to see you at last. Time passes inexorably: why are you always late? How unbelievable it is to make the other person wait like this! What has happened? Why are you not here? Everything is running through my head, I cannot stop my heart pounding in my chest, my stomach turning. What if you are not coming? What am I going to do? I cannot think about it. Me, without you, over there, so far, alone on the plane amongst strangers. Where are you? I cannot leave, I can't take that plane, you know that, right? Do you know? Everything screams inside me: what are you doing? Why aren't you there? Everything is a jumble inside me. The steward calls the passengers to the boarding gate. Tears are rolling down my face, I am petrified, devastated by your absence. Come, I beg you, come!
