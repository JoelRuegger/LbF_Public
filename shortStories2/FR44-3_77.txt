I am a very sensitive person, who can go from laughter to tears in a few seconds. Moments spent with my boyfriend increase my emotions. With him, I can go from one extreme to another. In the same day I can have crazy laughs and a few hours after I'm crying. I cannot control my emotions, which means I burst into tears very easily and over nothing. My boyfriend is not very expressive and he does not go to comfort me. He prefers to avoid problems. But I am a person who needs someone to take care of me when I am feeling very sensitive. However, I'm not sensitive about everything. I have never cried or been touched by a sad movie, because I know that in general it is not reality. I am more touched by a human being, because I can imagine the pain that others feel.
