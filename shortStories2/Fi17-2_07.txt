I join my friends in loud applause when the last band finishes playing. Part of the audience is still in a lively party mood when we start zigzagging our way through the crowd toward the exit. We walk toward the gates, and little by little, fewer people are around. I see in the distance a big, drunken man stumbling toward us. I don't pay attention to him because I'm so involved in our conversation. Suddenly, the man is right next to us, and he falls against me. He smells like cigarettes and booze, and I jump away from him. I cannot hold back a sneer. The man is stumbling around, his eyes half closed, then he suddenly throws up on me. I wince in horror as the foul-smelling vomit splashes on me. It sprays on the front of my coat and on my jeans. I feel nauseous, and I feel my own vomit raising in my throat. The man's yellow vomit drips from my coat onto my shoes and my bare hand.
