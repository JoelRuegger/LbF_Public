I open the fridge and look for something to eat. I feel like eating something light, but tasty. There is a carton of milk in the door and a packet of margarine on the upper shelf. In the vegetable box, there are some tomatoes and a cucumber I just bought. I take the milk, margarine and vegetables to the kitchen counter and close the fridge. I reach up on my tiptoes to get the granola box and bread from the cupboard, then place them on the counter as well. I cut a few thick slices of bread and put them in the toaster, then put the rest of the loaf in a bag. While the bread is in the toaster, I cut some tomato and cucumber slices. I get a bowl from the cupboard and pour granola and milk into it. When the bread is toasted, I put the bread on a plate and spread margarine and the sliced vegetables on them. I carry the granola and sandwich to the table and sit down to enjoy my meal.
