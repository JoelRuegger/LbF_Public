Today, for the first time, I return to a place where I used to spend all my winters. It's been eleven years since I last set foot in this pretty little ski resort. As I was used to doing at that time, with Nicolas, my favorite ski instructor, I used the same ski runs to recall the wonderful memories which mark my childhood. Of course, it was only about the green and blue tracks, because when I used to come, I was a novice skier. I am at a much higher level now, but all that matters to me is to hit the tracks of my childhood. Going down these tracks, I take the time to admire the landscape as I did with Nicolas, and I naturally start to sing the same tunes that we sang before. Passing the ski lift where I so often used to fall, I start laughing alone.
