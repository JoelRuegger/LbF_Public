It's hockey playoff time, and my team has made it into the semifinals. If we win this game, we're in the finals. My teammates and I fight really hard, and by the third period, the game is tied 2-2. No one scores during this final period, so the game goes into overtime. Everything is on the line now. After playing for a few minutes, I manage to pass the defense thanks to a nice pass from a teammate, and I'm alone against the goalie. My attention now is focused only on the puck and the goalie. The audience is going crazy, but they seem like they're far away. For a moment, the pain in my muscles and lungs is gone. I give the shot everything I have, and the puck slams into the upper corner of the goal. I raise my hands up in the air. All my insecurities and pressure are gone at that very moment, and I feel incredible pride and joy. I did it! The audience roars and cheers, and I can see my teammates' wide smiles as they skate toward me.
