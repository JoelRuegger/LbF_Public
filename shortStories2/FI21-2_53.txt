I'm at the dentist's office for a filling that I had been postponing for too long. I lie in the dentist's chair with safety goggles on and my mouth open. The dentist leans over me and starts examining my teeth. My neck and shoulders are hurting because I'm nervous and tighten my muscles unconsciously. I try to relax my body and breathe calmly. I feel like I'm not getting enough oxygen because I cannot breathe through my mouth. I feel uncomfortable. The dentist is using a metal tool to scrape my teeth and murmurs grumpily. I clench my sweaty fists around the back rest of the chair and struggle to stay still. My chin is hurting, and I taste plastic and metal in my mouth. The dentist gets up and turns around in his chair. I reach to see what is happening next. The drill starts buzzing and I put my head back on the chair and close my eyes. I feel dizzy.
