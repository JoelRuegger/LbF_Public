I'm at a party, and the atmosphere is fantastic. People are in a good mood, and the food and drinks are great. The party is in a big house, and there is joyful banter aplenty in every room. Somewhere, a live band is playing. I'm sitting on a sofa with my partner, and my best friend and I decide to get some more drinks. I also want to enjoy the party alone for a moment and look around the house. I walk upstairs and admire the beautiful d√©cor of the house. What a great evening. I sip my drink and decide to return to my friends and partner, then suggest we go listen to the band. I start walking downstairs, but slow down when I see two people leaning into each other in the shadows of a corner in the hall. I freeze on the stairs when I realize who these two people are: my partner and my best friend. I'm paralyzed and don't know what to think or do. I can't believe it! I feel the blood running out of my face as I watch them share a secret kiss. I grasp my glass in disbelief.
