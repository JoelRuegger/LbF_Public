I arrive home from a party and sit in front of a mirror to brush my hair. I went to a hairdresser before the party and received an amazing hairdo. They used a lot of hairspray at the hairdresser's, so it's going to be difficult to untangle my hair. They also back-combed my hair into an elegant beehive, which makes it even more difficult to handle. It would be a shame to undo such a fantastic hairdo, but I want to untangle my hair before going to bed. I know that in the morning, it would be even more difficult to untangle. I brush my hair carefully, starting from the sides. I hold my hair from the roots while I work through it. This way, brushing hurts less. When I have worked through my hair on the sides, I start untangling the back using a mirror. I work through my hair in small sections and my hair straightens and untangles surprisingly easily. I rub my scalp with my fingers for a moment, as it is a bit tender after the tight hairdo.
