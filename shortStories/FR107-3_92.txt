This time there was no doubt I was being followed. I knew this uncontrollable, unpredictable feeling of anguish and apprehension at the thought of having someone follow my steps. But I had this impression every time I went through this alley every night at 6 pm when I left school. Night fell early in spite of the arrival of spring, and darkness was not lacking in this dim and deserted alley. I hurried every night, always with the same invasive and stressful feeling of being followed. I felt it every day or at least when I was alone in an empty place like that. But that night, it had never been so intense. An icy silence reigned and I perceived the frail clap of my steps on the dark ground. I listened attentively to perceive a noise, a clap or a simple murmur that would confirm my hypothesis, but I heard nothing. I heard only the sound of the wind and my breathing.
