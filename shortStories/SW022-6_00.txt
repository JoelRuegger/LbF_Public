I am just 14 years old when I drive my moped from a side street to a main road, where the vehicles are standing due to a red traffic light. As I brake, my brake cable tears and I backpedal with all my strength, start to lean and fall. My moped slides directly under a truck standing on the main road. Now I realize that I will be run over as soon as the red traffic light of the main road changes to green. I'm trapped right underneath the truck and I can't free myself. Now the light turns green and the vehicles start, only my truck is still standing still. I'm trapped waiting for what's going to happen now, assuming it's going to be awful for me. A man comes up to me and says, "Hey, boy, I saw you slipping under my truck in the rear-view mirror, I'll pull you out right away." I don't know the name of this man, but to this day I'm indefinitely grateful to him.
