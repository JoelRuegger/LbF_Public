I sigh deeply. My breath rises into the sky in white clouds. They mix with the steam of the hot sausages on the plate. As is customary at Christmas, there's no one on the streets. I sigh again, deeper, louder, like there's a chance someone could hear it and pity me. Breathing heavily, I stomp through the village until I stop in front of my father's big barn. I smile as I think about the times when Markus and I spent all our time here. Again, I sigh, this time carefully and hardly audible. I put the plate down and push the barn door open with a powerful jerk. "Get out of here!" Markus calls out to me. I ignore him. Without saying a word, I move the beer bottles aside and place the plate and a small packet on the box which serves as a bedside table. "Come home," I whisper. "Please!" But my brother doesn't move. As every year at Christmas, I leave the barn alone and head back to my apartment to spend Christmas Eve without Markus.
