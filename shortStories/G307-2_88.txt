It's almost time. Soon. Chloe Hulligmann. How will I look? Will I make my parents proud? I want to be a doctor, travel to Africa, fight for human rights. When will the time finally come? Soon. "Family Hulligmann, the functioning of the uterus and umbilical cord is rescinded, oxygen and food are no longer reaching Chloe. Have you really thought about it thoroughly?" My mom: "Yes, we have thought about it for a very long time. It has to be." What? Is this about me? Stop! No! Mom, what are you doing? Dad, why are you for this? I'll make you proud, believe me! A tear rolls down my face. I'd love to tell them so much. I move to give them a sign. Dad, the value of every life is infinite. Mama, think of my still-to-be-lived life with all my developments and experiences. The doctor sits next to us and ... I had so many dreams, so many unfulfilled ideas. Mommy, Daddy, I wanted to make you so proud. I hope you can forgive yourself sometime, Mama. I love you both! Your Chloe.
