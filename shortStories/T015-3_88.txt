"If there is a mirror in the room where you sleep, somebody's spirit will watch you at night." It sounded like bullshit when I first heard it. A tale made up to scare the kids. But now I am spending my third hour in front of a mirror and I am guessing I have four or five more hours. You see, the shift has not yet ended. There are lots of things spirits must fulfill: for example, just yesterday I sat down at the empty chair near someone's bed until he woke up. As long as you are dead, life's toil follows you: one must be something beyond dead, you wouldn't even refer to me, I shouldn't even have a name. I feel like if we become little parts scattered across the universe those toils wouldn't find us. I can't remember how I died: I will remember in time. I think my inner consciousness is suppressing it because it was too dramatic. That inner consciousness wouldn't leave me alone when I was alive, either. I think this a universal element of humor, like love: wherever we go our inner self will follow.
