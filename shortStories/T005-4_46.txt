Everything happened on a regular day at March. Surely it would be a good day because they were serving roast beef at lunch! (If you are not a student struggling to get by, you won't understand what this means). But something happened and I ran late to lunch. Even though my friend insisted I chose the line, she knows I didn't, because I believe that other line was cursed. I couldn't believe my eyes: they were out of beef and serving chicken instead. Cold, leftover chicken. We bowed to our bad luck and took our chicken, and found a table. That day, that table was the first time I saw him. But neither of us was aware of that. We were about to start our lunch: "Wait, what's that?" They had started to serve beef again! Now this is a combination of tragedy, regret and despair. So unfair and so cold. But if I had another chance, if I knew that I would be meeting him, I would choose the same line: you didn't really expect me to say that, did you? Some regrets in life should never happen, dear friends. If you have a chance to choose beef over chicken, take the beef. Otherwise you will regret it.
