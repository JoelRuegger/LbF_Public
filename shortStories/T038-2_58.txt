I approached the window in the dead of the night. Lost my breath. Women lying on the street, covered in blood. Silent screams covered all the street. But nobody can hear them, and never did before. I felt my time was near. But peace invaded me. This ferocity will find its place in history. Maybe this will save our children. I will die for a reason. I felt I would be useful again after a long time. Peace invaded me. I heard the cracking noise of the door opening. Made my last prayer. I prayed for peace, only for peace. The door opened wide. Rude voices of boots, breath that stank of cigarettes came closer. I felt the coldness of the barrel on my skin. He pulled the trigger. Like the others, I fell on the ground covered in blood. When I was about to give my last breath, I caught his eye. It was him. The one I took cake recipes to, went shopping with, my neighbor whom I talked to while dropping our kids at school. How did we end up like this? Why did we become enemies? We killed in the past, now it was his turn. There was no triumph in his eyes. We both know it wasn't a victory. We said our goodbyes. He left. I died.
