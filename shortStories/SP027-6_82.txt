That year's local festival was a very special one. The night was very clear and calm, one of those nights that make you put on a sweater, unless you're going to be dancing and jumping around all the time. Which is what I was doing. What a wonderful night! There were some great bands playing in all the town's squares, and people were going from one to another, having fun, leaping about and dancing. You said hello to everyone, and everyone hugged and kissed you. There was a really good atmosphere. As the night wore on, people started going home, but I stayed on chatting to a boy. He suggested that we go and watch the sunrise from an unusual spot on the mountain. We walked along, talking and enjoying the countryside, and then we sat on a big rock that gave us a wonderful view of the valley, and the sun began to warm us. The day had arrived, but the magic of the night continued in that quiet, inhospitable place. It was a really nice end to the festival.
