I should have guessed it. No, how could I know? How many of us can predict that a stranger will change their life so dramatically while walking on the street? I understood that things would change from the moment we caught each other's eyes. But still everything was unpredictable, like the exact place a fallen leaf will land, and that time we looked at each other is the time leaf started to fall. Everything was rewritten until it touched the ground. My fate changed; I became a different man. But still one can remain calm while facing surprises in life and maybe this is how you travel through events without getting lost, from the creation of the world until the doomsday, which can fit in the period of a leaf falling down. Yes, from the moment the leaf started to fall, I dreamed of many events I would live through with her, but regretfully I must admit that I didn't come close to any of it. Maybe this is what they call the predictable obscurity of the future.
