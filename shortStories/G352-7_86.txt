I still remember the first weeks after the birth very well. I couldn't stop looking at him. He was so perfect, with his little button nose and his big wide eyes, his little feet and tiny toes. I was sure he was the prettiest and sweetest baby in the whole world. When I lay next to him and he slept, I couldn't take my eyes off him. I watched him lying there, so peacefully, sucking on his pacifier. And I listened to his soft, even breath. I couldn't get enough of cuddling up tightly with him, being very close to him. I had to cry often because it was so indescribably beautiful. I've never felt such a deep love for anyone before as I do for him. He is my life, my everything. Just the thought that something might happen to him turns my stomach. I'm so incredibly happy that I get to be his mother.
