When I woke up due to the bright sunlight that covered my face, I wasn't complaining about my cat who was lying on the other side of my face. I started my daily routine: smoke two cigarettes, feed the cats, water the plants, think about unimportant small details about life, smoke another cigarette, brush teeth, leave house. I was joyful like I hadn't been for a long time, and that got me worried. I entered the shop to buy a coffee. I faced someone energetic and smiling. He asked me how I liked my coffee. Suddenly my punch hit his face. In return he said, "What happened, Sir? Are you OK?" This got me angrier. I grabbed his hair, tugged the board marker pen from his mouth, and after hitting his head on the case a few times he was silenced. Now he was angry, too. He threw the coffee which was made for the fat ass customer who was late for work into my face. Jumping through the counter he punched my chin real hard. I came to, opened my eyes. The cashier said "Sir?" while waiting to write my name on the cup. I took my coffee, and left the shop in peace to go to work.
