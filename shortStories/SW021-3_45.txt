Dakar, in the center of West Africa. I had taken a course in African drumming and had come here to get maracas for our drum group. A little wandering around as a white man in Dakar is enough to be approached by various people, what one wants here. My answer was always, "I'm looking for maracas." At some point, I found someone who was willing to sell me some of these. However, he wanted to get the money in advance, justifying the purchase of raw materials. I agreed on the following: pre-payment of 9 Euro for a trial delivery of three rattles and then we will see further. A further meeting was arranged. But nobody came to the meeting. I didn't think anything bad about it, maybe my contact person was somehow prevented. A few days later, however, I happened to meet the very person again in a street caf√©. When I asked where the rattles were, the answer came: "I don't know you." With deep contempt, I said goodbye.
