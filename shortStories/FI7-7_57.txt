I wake up on a slow weekend morning and stretch out my limbs, which are slightly stiff after sleeping, and turn to look for you. Your eyes are still closed, but you give me a sleepy smile, so I know that you're awake. Morning light sifts through the window blinds and lands on your skin, and I touch those parts where the light is touching. You open your eyes, and we smile at each other. You wrap your arms around me and pull me into your lap. This is a good place to be. We kiss softly and slowly. I can feel your naked body on mine when you stroke my back gently. You let your hands slide lower, and I'm getting aroused. Your touch is familiar and confident. I sigh with pleasure. My body responds to your movements first slowly, then faster.
