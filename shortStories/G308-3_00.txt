Remember back at the farm? How we kids used to feed the cows in rubber boots at 6 in the morning? What fun it was. We used to ride out and swim in the fish pond. Remember back in Provence? We had a wonderful yellow villa, a huge garden with a boules alley and a swimming pool with its own diving board. What a pleasure it was. You often sat under a huge tree and read your book. Remember back in Tuscany? We had an avenue as a driveway and a garden which was so dreamlike that we called it a park. At lunchtime, we always had a breath-taking view over all of Montepulciano. It was wonderful then. I put some roses on your grave: they were your favorite flowers. Since you left, we haven't been on holiday, because it'll never be the same again. You're missed, and you've ripped open a deep hole. I hope you're OK where you are now. And maybe we'll travel again sometime, like we did back then.
