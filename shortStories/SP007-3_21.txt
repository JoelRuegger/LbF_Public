It's 6 a.m. and I'm at Vienna airport. I had planned to go back home tomorrow, but a close friend of my brother's died a few hours ago, and the funeral is at 5 p.m. My brother and I are very close. I know that he needs me and I want to be with him, to keep him company and give him support. In fact, I've been so worried that I haven't slept a wink. Then the voice on the PA system breaks into my thoughts: "For all passengers traveling to Barcelona: owing to technical problems at Barcelona airport, all today's scheduled flights have been cancelled. We apologize for the inconvenience. For more information, please go to the airline desk." That was my flight. I've tried asking for some sort of explanation and to find a solution of some kind, but without success. I've also been trying to phone my brother for some time, to warn him that I won't be arriving in time, and that I'm really sorry, but he's not answering his phone. Perhaps because it's so early, or maybe because he doesn't want to receive any calls right now. And so I'm stuck here at this airport, tired, frustrated and not really knowing what to do.
