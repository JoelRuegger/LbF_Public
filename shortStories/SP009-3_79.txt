Today is the day of my communion; it's a special day because of everything it entails, but mostly because I've received loads and loads of presents. I'm particularly happy about one gift: my first ring. It's really lovely: it's made up of three bright gold oval strands crowned with a little pearl. I gaze at it proudly, squeezing it with my slender fingers, and I say to myself: "I must try this princess's ring on." Turning it delicately, I slide it onto my index finger and I observe the effect with satisfaction. Then my mother's shout – "It's breakfast time!" – brings me back to reality. I try to take off the ring, but it's stuck fast on my finger. I try again, starting to get a bit nervous, but the little ring just won't budge. I'll never be able to get it off again! They'll have to cut off my finger! A dark shadow descends upon me and my eyes begin to fill with tears, as I desperately try – now using my teeth – to pull off the ring and free my finger. Several long minutes later, the ring lies on my bedside table, without its little pearl, which snapped off and is now lying beside it. We princesses will be going without our rings.
