I am at the tram station and pick up my little daughter, who has just been on an excursion with her class. She gets out last, with hanging head and tears in her eyes. I ask the teacher what happened. He has no idea and tells me that she was fun and bright all day long. I ask my daughter and she sobs something about a dog. Then her friend comes along and explains that our neighbor's dog has died. He had to be put to sleep for health reasons, and she just found out. I take my daughter in my arms and say: "The dog had to be put to sleep, that was certainly the best thing for him. But I don't understand why you're so sad. You have hardly ever seen the dog and perhaps patted it twice." She replies: "Yes, that's true, but I heard it every day. He used to bark and I knew he was there. Now he's gone and I miss his barking."
