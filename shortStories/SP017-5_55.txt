Three years ago, when I was living in the Netherlands, a fellow student (who is now a close friend of mine) invited me to his home one Saturday, to meet his family, his wife and his two charming children. He told me to drop by at 18:00. Well, as I was from Spain and I'd never been invited to anybody's home in that country before, I wasn't too sure of what they would be offering me. If someone in Spain invites you to his home at 18:00, you can expect a few snacks and then, finally, the evening meal. The family was Polish, which meant that we drank lots of beer that night. Fortunately, they didn't get the vodka out. Anyway, by 21:00 I was hungry and extremely drunk. I couldn't keep up with the way they drank, and so I told them I was leaving. They were absolutely amazed. "But it's only 9 o'clock!" they said. "Yes, but if I carry on drinking without eating anything, I might end up throwing up on your sofa." "Wait ... haven't you had any supper?" In the end they gave me the leftovers from their supper so that I didn't die of alcohol poisoning.
