I was so happy that day that I had to do something good and different. I called my sister, one of the people in this world with whom I always think of sharing something when I am happy. I invited her to travel to a surprise destination. She immediately said yes. I told her to meet me at the airport and that I had already bought the tickets. I was so glad I could share my happiness with someone I really like that, on my way home, I began to think about the true meaning of this feeling. And I wondered if leaving the country would be really necessary, given that I could do so much in the place where I was. 
Even so, I went home and checked our reservation to the only place wherein I know we would feel even happier. This place was our country, São Tomé e Príncipe. A paradise in the center of the world. I arrived at the airport and my sister was already there. We gave each other a huge hug. After an 8 hour-flight, we arrived at our destination and our happiness could not have been greater. We would have the opportunity to meet again all those we had left behind so many years ago. As soon as we got off the plane, we understood better the meaning of the expression: "Home is where our heart is," and ours was definitely, and will always be, in São Tomé.
