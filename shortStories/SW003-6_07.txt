You. As I saw you for the first time, you reminded me of a song. It was a song I heard a long time ago and forgot again. For me it was like déjà vu: seeing you was just like hearing the song. That moment was magical. It was far too magical for me to move. You felt it, too, just like me. So, we stood still, motionless, until the short moment was over. At the time, we didn't know the song was written in G minor. We were not aware of that. We just felt it. The feeling has stayed and won't let go of me. Now I miss the time before that, the time before you reminded me how it could be. It was so much easier when I could go to bed at night without knowing that there was someone like you out there – without knowing that there was someone who reminded me of G minor – without knowing what G minor felt like.
