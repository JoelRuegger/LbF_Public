Only 6 hours left and I am not ready for even half of the possible scenarios. Let's say she is half an hour late, then it's 6.5 hours. I am too late, I should have started this weeks ago. Anything can happen. We might not like each other or I might like her but she won't: worst, what if we like each other? I must get ready for all this. Women are such complex creatures. Maybe men are, too, but honestly, I don't really care. There is nothing as amazing as women. We are talking about a cute creature who has lots of ideas, emotions, stories, etc. It is not easy. Should I shake her hand or hug her? I should have made these decisions before. Or maybe I shouldn't: I don't know. I got all tense again. I want to be myself, but I don't like myself enough to introduce someone else. They say women understand those sorts of things. I don't know: it sounds to me like superstition. I hope it is. It would be too much if they also have supernatural powers above all this magnificence.
