I don't say anything. I listen, or pretend at least, because I don't want to listen anymore. But I also pretend not to listen. I don't know if I want to change or stay myself. I don't know if I want to make my family happy or unhappy, so I put everything aside, I store my thoughts and leave them behind. I would like to stop thinking about these small problems that may be unnecessary or will change nothing in the end. But they are there, and I have to listen again when I'm surely in denial. I want to get out of the room, say what I think, shout, or show them that I'm tired and hurt. Tell them I'm unconventional and I don't mind. But basically I remember that I've already told them, that this scene has already happened, and that nothing seems to change, only there is more and more trouble and guilt. They want to forget it. This is repeated all the time.
