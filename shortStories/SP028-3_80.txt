I went to live in another city, and I needed to find a shared apartment where I could stay for a year. After three weeks of intense searching, I found the perfect flat. It was small, cozy, near a Metro station and a bus stop, and I'd be sharing with a girl and a boy. The boy was very friendly. As soon as I moved in I became great friends with him. It was a bit more difficult with her. She hardly spoke and never left her room. We became worried, and so we knocked on her door to ask if she wanted to eat with us, but we couldn't persuade her to come out. Finally, a while later, an episode took place that was quite unpleasant for all of us. Her ex-partner came to see her: he wanted his belongings back. As she was afraid of his bad temper, she didn't want to let him in, so we suggested that she pass him his things down from the balcony, and that's what she did. After a long argument, which had all the neighbors listening, and a good deal of insults and yelling, our flatmate shut the window and told us all about what had gone on between them, and afterwards we understood why she'd been behaving so strangely up until now. From that day on, we tried to give her our support and make her feel better.
