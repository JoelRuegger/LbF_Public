The alpine herbs smell wonderfully fresh in the morning hours. Place the paraglider on the cool grass and start running. Then it's like a stroke of a bird's wing and I … float. I look east to the Finsteraarhorn and west to the Matterhorn and feel in awe of these white peaks, above them the blue of the sky. I reach out with my arms and embrace the whole world with happiness. An eagle flies directly toward me. Just in front of me it veers away, flies to my left wing and we turn our circles. My heart bounces – flying with an eagle means bliss to me. The eagle swings up faster to new heights and I see the red peaks in the south. The forest shines in the sun's rays from yellow to light green to dark green. Time to land – I look at my meadow and land gently like an angel on Earth. What remains is the wonderful feeling, a flight – an unforgettable, fascinating experience.
