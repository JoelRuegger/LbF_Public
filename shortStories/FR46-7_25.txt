The happiness of becoming a big sister for the first time in your life is such a magical feeling ... At that time I was only 2 years old and I did not understand the feeling of happiness that I was going to experience when I took you in my arms on our mother's bed at the maternity hospital, this Wednesday, November 19th, 1998. You were very small and cute in your little bed. I even remember telling Dad that when I got home, I wanted to put you in my doll stroller, because you were too small to walk. I loved you so much and then, at the age of 6, our little brother was born. For my part I was for a second time overcome by happiness and for the first time you could feel this need to protect this little being ... The happiness of being a big sister. For nothing in the world would I allow you to disappear from my life. I love you so much Oceane and Leo. My pride.
