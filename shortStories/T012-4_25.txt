There was a man named Arif in our neighborhood. It was 2002, I was 4 or 5 years old. Arif was mute and deaf. He lost his hearing later in his life. That's why when he was trying to say something he yelled: we kids were afraid of him. And I knew he used our fear. He always chased us and yelled. My mom always told me that he wasn't chasing me but was trying to talk to me: I shouldn't be afraid. But I was a kid and couldn't grasp what she said. Anyway, one day I was going to the market. I checked for Arif, but couldn't see him anywhere. "This is the right time to go," I thought, and started walking. But Arif was waiting at the market's entrance to yell at me. I started to run, Arif on my tail. When I turned to check if he was still following, I tripped on a rock and fell. I hit the ground so hard, my loose baby tooth which I didn't let anyone touch flew out of my mouth. Damn you, Arif, look what you did? I spent my years in the fear of coming across Arif but that time I learned I can lose what's valuable to me while running away from my fears.
