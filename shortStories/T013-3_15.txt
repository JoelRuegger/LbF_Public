I was the only one to find the courage to answer the door when was knocked. The hooded man entered the room. His face was in the dark. In the darkness of his face, his red eyes burned like a fire. The hand he took out from under his robe was cold, lifeless and had skin like a snake. He ran this hand across our faces and hair. After touching each of us he murmured something we couldn't understand. He was picking someone for months and in return we were finding baskets of food on our doorstep. There was no adult here that would take care of us, protect us, because all the adults had disappeared from the face of the world. The only adult we could see was the hooded man who came to our door on certain days and took one of us. All this started a year ago. There were only four or five kids left in the orphanage. I was trying to hide my fear since I was the oldest of the kids. But I was terrified. The hooded man stood in front of me, his burning eyes directed at me. I lost my breath, felt like I was dying. He whispered to my ear with a voice as cold as stone, asking "You want them to live, right?"
