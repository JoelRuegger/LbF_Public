I greet my friends and thank them for their congratulations on my recent engagement. The sound of the sea provokes me and diverts my attention from the pleasant conversations about my future. I ramble mentally about recent moments that made me feel euphoric – new travels, book acquisitions and the donation of several books that I have already read. Altruism and benevolence grant a state of peace that no material good will ever bring me. The contagious happiness of those who are helped, especially the smaller ones, makes me nostalgic and proud of when I was a child. Across the table, the others cannot contain their excitement. They look constantly over my shoulder, until they tell me, excitedly, to look back. With tremendous surprise and instantly enthusiasm, I see my best friend right next to my mother. He smells several benches until he sees me and gets off of the leash that holds him. He runs up to me, jumps on to my lap and licks my face. I wonder if he knows he is too big, but I understand … I have not seen him in months. Then, everyone at the table, I confess my wish, that is discussed and accepted: I want the dog to hold the wedding rings. When I look at him, he watches me, and pricks his ears.
