After long hours of waiting and counting the time between contractions, finally we went into the delivery room. Following the instructions of the gynecologist and the midwife, maximum dilation was reached and, in a very short space of time, the process took on an extraordinary speed. "Push, Esther, now! With all your strength! NOW!" I was dressed up in green scrubs, a hairnet and plastic overshoes: I looked like the third member of the medical team. It was, however, the first birth I had ever witnessed. The first birth because I was about to see my first child, Oriol. When his head and half his body was out, they let me give him his final tug. I took him in my hands and, even though a newborn baby can't see much more than light and shadows, I sensed he was looking at me. I immediately knew that this wonderful moment would last me for the rest of my life.
