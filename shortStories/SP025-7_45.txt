Summer was almost over and the day was fast approaching when I would have to leave my home town and go off to a new city. It was also my last week at work. During all this time, I had been experiencing mixed emotions – melancholy, sadness, as well as happiness and anticipation, because I was leaving a job where I had made some great friends while doing my teacher training. Every day my farewell was drawing closer; I dreaded that day because I really don't like goodbyes at all, but instead it turned out to be one of my best days – my locker had been filled with surprises and there was a lovely note from all my colleagues. But that wasn't all – my friends and family had got together to organize a party, and when I left work and went out into the car park to find my car, there was a huge banner waiting for me: all my friends and family were waiting for me, to take me to my party. Those were moments that I'll never forget, and for which I'll always be grateful to those people.
