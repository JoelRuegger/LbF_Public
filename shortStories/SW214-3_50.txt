It was during my Erasmus semester, the European student exchange program. During the Christmas season, I wanted to fly home to finally see my family again, after several months. On arriving at the airport, it was impossible to depart because of the bad weather. There was very dense fog. I waited all afternoon without any new information about when we would finally depart. At 7 p.m., we finally got the announcement that my flight was cancelled. I felt an enormous sadness at the thought of not being able to see my family that evening. I didn't want to go back to my student apartment an hour away. So, I walked around the airport for hours trying to find an alternative flight. Only at five o'clock in the morning of the following day did I manage to get a flight home. I was totally exhausted and tired. After another hour of delay, we finally were able to take off.
