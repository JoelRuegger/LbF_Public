I want to kiss you! Often! And everywhere. I want to have water fights with you while brushing our teeth. I want to be tickled until I can't breathe anymore, and at breakfast touch your feet under the table. I want to be protected by you and protect you. I want to sing and dance with you. I wish you didn't feel completely whole without me. I want to talk into the morning. I want to walk in the rain with you and kiss your face, wet from the rain. Eat warm cookies with you in my favorite wool socks and listen to nice music. There's nothing better than waking up beside you. I want to drown in your eyes and feel at home. My t-shirts should hang next to your socks on the clothesline and your voice should give me goose bumps. I want to spend a lot of time with you and mutual friends. I don't want to be able to wait to be alone with you again, though. And when you cry, I will comfort you and be strong. I want to cry at night with happiness when we make love. Again, and again!
