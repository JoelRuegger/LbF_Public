I'm about to enter the caf√© when I see Alexandra at a distance. We were inseparable at secondary school, but after graduation each went on their way. Different ways. It doesn't matter how close we were or the promises we made to keep in touch, we easily went from great friends to mere acquaintances. But I missed and I miss her so much! I never tried to get in touch because ... for so many reasons ... I do not know why exactly. Probably it was just procrastination. I told myself that if she wanted to talk to me, she would have done so, but I know this is just an excuse. And so I keep losing people. 
Alexandra sees me and waves after all. I approach carefully, cautiously, but it is as if nothing had changed, as if we saw each other yesterday, rather than years ago. We talked about everything that happened to us in the meanwhile and I can see that she missed me as much as I missed her. And it is ridiculous because we were both a phone call away. I think that what I am trying to say is: if you want to talk to someone, do it, do not postpone. The other person may want the same, and it is worth finding out.
