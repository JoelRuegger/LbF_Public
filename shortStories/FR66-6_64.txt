On leaving college with my friends, I noticed that the buses were no longer running. This disruption was due to the arrival of the President of the Republic in our charming city. So I decided to go home with my friends, since we lived more than three miles away. We were in the middle of winter and yet there was a beautiful sun and the temperatures were unusually mild, which made the trip rather enjoyable. Moreover, as there were several of us, we chatted and laughed, so that the journey passed quickly. Once we arrived in the city center, it was time for us to separate, because we lived in very different places. I found myself alone, thinking that the rest of the journey would henceforth be more painful. But I was totally mistaken. I passed through little streets that I did not know, along the river. I felt like I was rediscovering my city. It was a nice walk.
