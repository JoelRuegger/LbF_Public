My favorite band is performing in Finland, and I'm at the concert with a good friend. We arrived at the club early to get good seats near the stage, and we're only a few rows back. The audience is in a good mood, and excitement fills the air. Occasionally, people start clapping and shouting for the band to come on stage. However, the stage remains dark and empty. My friend and I exchange anticipatory gazes, then I join the others in cheering when the guitarist and drummer climb on the stage. Suddenly, the lights go on, and the whole audience starts to cheer. I clap my hands excitedly and struggle to peer over people's heads to see the band better. Soon, the audience turns into a sea of dancing and jumping people. I love the songs, and I know them all by heart. My arms and legs are not tired from dancing or jumping, and I close my eyes and let the music take over my body.
