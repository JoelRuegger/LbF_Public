It was a warm July evening at the Tıp Çermik. We used to sit on the balcony of our house from sunset till midnight. Our balcony, which usually was a windy place, was so still tonight. I, my mother, my aunt and my two cousins were sitting on the balcony. The two grown-ups were trying to talk while doing handicrafts, but were disturbed by the four kids of 8, 10, 12 and 13. Suddenly my aunt offered 20 Turkish Lira for an hour of silence. We accepted eagerly. When the silence game was coming to an end, we heard a rustle in the tree. We saw a giant rat rushing toward us between the branches of the tree. We were in shock and my big cousin yelled "R-r-r-aat!" But the silence game? We each won 20 Turkish Lira, and about the rat, we were going to see her a couple of times with her three babies.
