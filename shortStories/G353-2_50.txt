I met a very good friend I hadn't seen for a very long time. He told me that his long-time companion had died in a traffic accident and that after that he was so badly off that he couldn't work for a long time. He could not stop thinking about the accident and wondering whether his companion had suffered very much. He also often wondered whether he could have avoided having his companion drive to work by car that morning. For a long time, these thoughts did not let him go, so that he became unable to work and also lost his job. When he lost his job, things went completely downhill, because he had the feeling that he no longer had anything to hold on to. This is the situation he's in right now and reports at the moment, not knowing how things should continue.
