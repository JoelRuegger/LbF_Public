A couple of years ago or so I decided to have an eye operation – the well-known laser treatment. It's not that I was particularly short-sighted; it's just that it meant I had to wear glasses all the time, and I love doing sports. After they'd done all the tests to see whether my case could be treated satisfactorily, it was time for the operation. So, one day at the clinic, two days putting drops in my eyes and, in theory, on the third day I should be able to see without using glasses. Unfortunately, this didn't turn out to be the case with my right eye. A stubborn white layer meant that I couldn't see anything very clearly. The days went by, more drops in my eyes, more trips to the clinic, more waiting, more patience, more drops in my eyes, and more trips. Then they started reeling out all the statistics, and the fact that there was a 0.0001% chance that I might have developed an infection. There had only been one similar case before, there were no other precedents, no expected time frame, my blurry vision could last for a month or for years … more drops in my eyes, more trips to the clinic, more patience and resignation: I was the one from the statistics.
