I'm looking for a fast-food place for dinner because I didn't have time for lunch. I don't know the city that well, and I'm becoming impatient. Hunger growls in my stomach. I see a burger kiosk, and I decide to go there, as there is nothing better available. I order my burger, and I stand aside to wait. While I'm waiting, I look around and notice that it is not one of the cleanest burger joints I've seen. There is grime on the deep fryer and stove, and the cook is not wearing plastic gloves. There's a foul smell in the air as well. “That's OK,” I think to myself. I'm so hungry. Finally, I get my burger and walk away. After removing the wrapping, I take a big bite of the burger, and the taste of disgusting, rotten meat fills my mouth. I feel sick, and I spit out the greasy piece of meat. I take a closer look at the burger, and I grin when I see the gray rotten meat.
