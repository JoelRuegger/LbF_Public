It's a rainy Sunday, and my roommate and I decide to make it cleaning day. It's been a while since the last cleaning, and we both agree that it's time to do it. We drink coffee at the kitchen table and discuss how we should divide the tasks. We agree that I will start by doing the dishes and that my roommate will vacuum the floors. I turn on the radio and put on a pair of rubber gloves. My roommate digs out the vacuum cleaner, while I fill the sink with warm water. On one side of the sink, I add lemon-scented dish soap, with the other side used as rinsing water. I start cleaning the dishes and whistling to the music on the radio. When I finish washing, rinsing, and drying the dishes, I put them in the cupboard. Finally, I rinse and dry our coffee cups and porridge kettle Â that had been soaking. The vacuum cleaner stops, so now I can hear the music better. I put the porridge kettle away in the kitchen drawer before beginning my next chore.
