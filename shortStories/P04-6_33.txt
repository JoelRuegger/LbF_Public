I found a slim girl sheltering from the rain. I offered her my umbrella and made my way home under the merciless rain. The next day, on my way to work, I found her again. When she saw me, she smiled. That smile ... Only that smile. As if it were the sun breaking the weeping of the clouds. When I saw it, and when I see it, I forget everything. There are no more problems. There is no more pain. There is no more anger. 
I tried to pull myself together and, after a few seconds that seemed to me an eternity, I managed to speak to her. I asked her what her name was, and why she was at the same place where I had found her the day before. She told me, with a shy smile, that she lived nearby, and that she was waiting for me. My heart began to beat like a drum. Then I asked her why she was waiting for me. She told me that she wanted to give me back my umbrella. I laughed while she looked at me with a puzzled look. I thanked her for her kindness, took my umbrella, and continued on my way. I have never seen her again. I like to think that one day I will see that smile again. That mythical smile that stopped everything around her.
