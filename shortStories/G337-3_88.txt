In exactly thirteen minutes, I would know the answer. Know if my life would change fundamentally. I asked myself idly while my gaze followed the second hand constantly on its way, which was better in the end. Ignorance, which meant a constant fluctuation between worry and hope, or certainty â€“ with its irreversible consequence. But now I was sitting here at the end of a long, white-painted corridor waiting. Then I heard faint steps come toward me. A pale little boy, probably six years old, with a baseball cap on his head and a teddy bear in his arm, sat down on the empty seat next to me. "Do you also have to see the doctor?" He pointed to the door across from us. "Yes," I replied. "If all is well with my blood, I can go home again next week! Do you also have leukemia?" he asked. "I don't know yet," I said quietly when the door opened and I was called in. I was already in the doctor's office when the little boy came in and pressed the teddy bear into my hand: "You take it, and everything will be all right!"
