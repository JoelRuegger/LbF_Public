Depression had settled and there was no turning back. I was alone. The feeling of anguish was huge, but it worsened even more when, at the end of that summer, I applied to the university. I did not enter my first choice for 0.1% and I thought that the sense of condemnation would drive me crazy once and for all. I mean, I was already crazy, but it was a secret madness, for I had hidden it from all those around me and I had learned to deal with it alone. Little did I know what was yet to come. In August 2015, the news that a great friend of mine had died in a bus crash was received with a sense of surprise and shock that left me with no reaction. After letting the tears run down my face and the pain breaking the little that was left of my heart, I automatically got in the car and drove aimlessly. I did not want to believe, but the truth is that our Josefina had abandoned us forever. I survived, day after day, with all these nefarious events in my memory, not knowing how I would wake up each day and find a bit of strength to face the sun that lasted outside. Then I met Josefa.
