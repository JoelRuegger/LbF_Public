Barbecue is not something we do often or something we love. Long story short: we are not a barbecue family. That's why when my daughter insisted on having a barbecue I couldn't say no, I didn't want to. That day, a friend of my wife came to visit from out of town and wanted to meet. So when I was left alone with the twins I wanted to change the plan and have barbecue on another day. But how would I convince the kids about not doing something I had promised to? Our neighbor who overheard us said he was alone too and we could take care of it together: hearing this I said OK. When I fired up the barbecue, I realized things were different. It turned out that only two people from his already crowded family was missing. Luckily, his grandfather also fired up his barbecue and saved the day. While all this was happening, my boy didn't listen to me at all and insisted on standing like a pole to watch the other neighbors who were trying to host their guests. I think I need to learn to use the word no.
