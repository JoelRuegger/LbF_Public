It's an ordinary weekly meeting at my workplace, and we're all gathered in the meeting room. Our team leader is in charge of the meeting, and occasionally, others take part in the conversation. The meeting's tempo is easygoing, and the atmosphere is very concentrated. We go through the agenda, which includes goals for the next few months and employees' roles and tasks. This time, I don't have an active role, and I can concentrate more on listening. On the table in front of me is a cup of hot coffee and my calendar, which I use for taking notes. I pick up a pen and follow the slide show projected on the wall while sipping my coffee. A colleague next to me leans toward me and whispers something. I need to struggle to hear her. I nod in understanding and answer in a low voice, covering my mouth with my hand. I then turn my attention back to the speaker and the ongoing presentation.
