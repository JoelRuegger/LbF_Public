I waited for three days and three nights, didn't eat, didn't sleep, just waited. He told me he would come for sure, so he definitely would. When the third night was ending, I closed my eyes. I wanted to hear a voice, his footsteps. I got closer to the door. Got angry with it for not being knocked. I hated the door. I opened my eyes: everywhere I looked was filled with him. I hated my home. And my body was filled entirely with him, I hated myself eventually. There is only one thing left to be done, the thing I least wanted. I went outside; the streets were empty. During the dawn the only thing to be heard was the birds chirping. I couldn't grasp why birds are always happy. I reached his home: its curtains were shut tight. I rang the bell, waited. Silence. I rang again. There were his footsteps coming closer, the voice I had craved to hear for three days. The door opened partly; half-sleeping, he looked me in the eyes. I took out my gun. He didn't flinch. I pulled the trigger. A body hit the ground, I can't remember whether it was his or mine.
