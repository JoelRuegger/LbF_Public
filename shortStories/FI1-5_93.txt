It's a Friday night, and I'm leaving home for the gym, which is located next to a shopping mall, so I park my car in the mall's lot. I'm in a good mood because I can start my weekend more relaxed after a workout. After my workout, the lot is now full of cars. I walk to my car and notice families all around me with their children and shopping carts. I'm glad I did my shopping for the weekend yesterday and avoided long lines at the supermarket. I can just go home and start my weekend. I reach my car, open the door and get behind the wheel. I throw my gym bag onto the front seat and take out my cell phone. I want to check messages and incoming calls before I start driving. After checking my phone, I start my car, glance into the rearview mirror and drive out of the parking lot to go home.
