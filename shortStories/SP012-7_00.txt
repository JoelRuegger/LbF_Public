In the early 1990s, music schools were classical in terms of their genre and methodology, far removed from jazz, modern harmony and improvisation. But owing to the whims of fate, a Dutch musician from Iowa who played jazz turned up in my town. He was a friendly, interesting, educated man, slightly bohemian, generous and â€¦ rather broke. He offered to give a small group of us musicians classes on an informal but regular basis for a reasonable price, and he taught us all the 1950s American standards. One of the most important lessons he taught us was after our first performance. We gave him the money they had paid us, and he told us to drop by his house that evening. When we arrived, we found him out on his patio, barbecuing lamb and with a table set ready, which included the finest wines. He had spent the money from the performance on celebrating his success with his students. It was a great evening. Soon afterward, Paul left town. But we musicians, however, carried on playing jazz every fortnight, and every so often he drops by the town where he sowed the seed of jazz, friendship and generosity.
