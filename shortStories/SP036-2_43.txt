Death. I see it, I feel it, I analyze it. All my body, my very being, becomes frozen and paralyzed. These symptoms tend to appear at certain specific moments. In the mornings, when the color and the spice of life were taken from me, I am overtaken by an emptiness that causes me to become amorphous, lost and purposeless. Why go on? These few seconds, minutes, become crystallized in time. All I can see is a spectrum of gray tones, spread out before me. Night-time is when the silence and loneliness come to visit me. As if a tornado has arrived to overstimulate all my body's nerve fibers, I am gradually seized by panic, until I suffer from nothingness. I imagine my body – now more awake than ever – 6 feet underground, disappeared into a vast ocean of invisible particles. There it is: the whole contradiction of my being, the light and dark side, back and forth. The calm and the storm. The depressive and the anxiogenic. Although they get on so well together.
