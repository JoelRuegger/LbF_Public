My single, 93-year-old great aunt had a request on my last visit: she hadn't been in the city center for 5 years. She wanted to see the big Christmas tree just once more. When I stopped our taxi directly at Marienplatz, the driver and I helped her get out. With her wrinkled hands, she clenched herself tightly under my arm. I pushed her as carefully as possible through the crowd, which my great aunt obviously hadn't expected and was afraid of. And then we stood in front of the tree and stared at it. "I kind of remember the tree bigger." I looked around in amazement at this comment and found a tear in her proud eyes. "Let's go. That's enough for me now, I think." Soon after, I put her back in the taxi. She held me for a moment, looked at me, with her eyes still wet and just said "Thank you." When I waved to the taxi through the crowd shortly afterward, waving to say goodbye, tears ran down my face. She'd be alone again for Christmas.
