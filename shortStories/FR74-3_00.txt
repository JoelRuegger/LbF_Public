A new life began for me and my mother. This change of life was due to the sudden death of my father in a car accident on his way home from work. After his death, my mother could no longer remain in this town, this house, this kitchen, where everything reminded her of her husband, all her memories stifled her. We decided to move away from this place full of painful memories, and to settle in the South of France, thinking that the sun, the heat and the cicadas would help us to start a new life without pain. For my mother, the change of scenery was pleasant and helped her to forget. But this change didn't have the same effect on me, who didn't want to move. I wanted to stay near my father, in his house, as it helped me to think of the good memories I had with him. But I made the choice to say nothing to my mother, because for her, to remain in this house was too painful.
