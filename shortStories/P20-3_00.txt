It was just another day at work. Everything remained the same, the same smells mixed with the scent of the glass-cleaning product. The same routine does not motivate me, it bores me. The first customer arrived, Sir Manuel, a regular customer. He actually spends more time here than at home. He orders the same as usual. It is like this here, the same as usual. In a while, the room begins to fill with families. Infernal boisterousness, children crying, screaming mothers and fathers who prefer to pretend that it is nothing to do with them. These are the Sundays here. When I look at the entrance I see a lady who sometimes comes with a small child. I feel tightness in my heart whenever I see her. It is such a strange feeling! I feel like crying. The lady is dressed in a very old suit, not to mention the suffering that comes from her look and her voice. I try to disguise myself so I do not embarrass the lady. She orders vegetable soup for the child and gazes at her while she eats. This is not the first time this has happened. I believe that the lady does not even have money to pay for the soup she orders. I explain the situation to my boss. He is so cold and inhuman. He only tells me that nothing here is for free. This creature irritates me. For him, people are just money-making machines. Asshole!
