I'm spending the night out with friends. I've been waiting for this all week: good food and drinks, and the fantastic company of my friends. The atmosphere is relaxed and joyful, and nobody has to hurry off anywhere. We've known each other for a long time, and we go over all the funny things that have happened over the years. We also start planning future adventures and throw around ideas, such as backpacking trips to Asia and sailing courses in South America. Throughout the night, the stories get better and wilder. I can feel how I can really relax in my friends' company. One of my friends starts to tell a funny story, and we start joking about it. The story continues and gets wilder, and soon, the whole group bursts out laughing, seemingly forever. I laugh so hard that I have tears in my eyes. How lucky I am to have people like this around me!
