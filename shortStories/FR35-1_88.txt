Today, I went to the equestrian center to ride a horse. It was then that I noticed that my favorite horse was not in his box. Worried, I searched everywhere, without success. I finally found someone who told me that this horse was dead. He had been taken to the butcher because he was no longer fit for the club's requirements: he had become too difficult to handle for the riders. I thought my heart was going to explode, my sorrow was so strong. I fled, my steps were random, I did not know where I was going, but that did not matter to me. Even being knocked down by a car did not matter to me at that time. I was so sad: what would I do without him? When I felt bad, spending time with this horse was enough to ease all my tensions, but now he was gone. It was difficult to imagine and especially terribly unfair. He was still young: he still had good years to live.
