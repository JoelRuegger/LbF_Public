I'm walking home from the movies with a friend. We're deep into a conversation about the film when we stop at a stoplight. The light turns green, and we start crossing the street. Suddenly, my phone rings, and we stop talking. My friend is a couple of steps ahead of me when I stop to dig out my cell phone. My friend stops in the middle of the crosswalk to wait for me. It's my boss's number on the screen, and I decide to answer promptly. I wonder why he would be calling me, so I start going over last week's work in my mind. Suddenly, I hear the loud sound of brakes. I flinch and look up and see a car coming from behind a corner, heading straight for my friend. Everything happens quickly, and I manage to close my eyes just as there is a horrible thump when the car hits her. I open my eyes and stare blankly forward. I can hear my boss on the phone, but it's a distant voice and I cannot recognize the words. I can see my friend lying on the crosswalk in a distorted position, looking like a ragdoll that was thrown there. Her leg is crushed, and red blood pools in the street.
