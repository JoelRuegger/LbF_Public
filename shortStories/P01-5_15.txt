The wonderful scent of lavender reminded me of Estela's house in Chile. Her house always smelled good, like lavender, just like her. I felt overwhelmed by a mixture of sadness and longing. She was a very pretty girl, though she did not speak. She had many suitors who would do anything for her to speak: they sang, they played, they told jokes, but she did not utter a single word, until when a very poor boy came and fell in love with her. The boy took Estela to the beach and asked her to help him paint some pictures. She did so, without saying a single word. After many days of hard work with the silent help of Estela, she saw that the boy was destroying everything he had done and then asked him, "What are you doing?"
The boy just smiled at her and she smiled back. Finally, Estela had spoken! On the day of their wedding, the house was beautiful, decorated with lavender. It smelled so good! The worst was yet to come. When Estela was walking down the aisle, radiant, beautiful, with a lavender branch in her hands, an old suitor, who had not succeeded in making Estela talk, appeared and killed her. She fell into the arms of her fianc√© and, smiling, the last thing she said was, "You were the only one who did not give up on me. Thank you for that."
The branch fell from her hands and a scent of lavender spread all over the room.
