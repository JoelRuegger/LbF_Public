It's already late as I leave the party to walk home. I'm tired and decide to take a shortcut, as the familiar and safe route would be longer. I turn off the busy road onto a smaller street. I rush from one corner to another, and the noise from the cars and people become more distant with every step. I turn into a narrow alley, which is illuminated only by a dim street light. At that moment, the street lamp makes a rattling sound and goes out. I am now so far away from the city center that I only hear my own fast footsteps. I keep my gaze on the ground and increase my speed. I hear steps ahead and raise my eyes. It's dark, but I see a suspicious group of men turn into the alley and walk briskly toward me. I stop and turn around to retreat. “This was a bad idea,” I think. I take a couple of steps, but I freeze because three others are approaching from that direction. My heart is pounding, and I wrap my coat tighter around me. I look behind me, then in front. I see somebody take out a knife. The group is approaching me, laughing ominously, and I feel my heart pumping hard in my ears.
