My doctor told me that I was infected with a severe and tedious flu. For 2 weeks now, I have been lying in bed, frustrated and bored, and I can't do anything or meet anyone. I can't receive visitors because I don't want to infect my friends. So, I lie in bed, already with back pain from lying down, and think about how nice it would be to go out and enjoy the sun. But these thoughts frustrate me even more. Then I think, "Stop whining, it's just a flu," but the long wait for an improvement is dragging on endlessly and patience has never been my strength. So, I take a few more pills, for the pain in my limbs and the fever, that my doctor gave me and try to distract myself by watching television. But during the day they seem to run only boring programs and talk shows, which I don't even want to see bored and lying in bed with the flu.
