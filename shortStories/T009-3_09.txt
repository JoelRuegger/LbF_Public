I am living with my elderly mother. I am trying to help her, make her happy as much as I can. But it is not always easy because of her age and minor dementia. Every day we go for a walk at the seaside. Sometimes we walk to the shore, drink some tea and sometimes we drive to a nearby village. Today we left home for a walk. On our regular way we saw the stray dog which was looked after by the people nearby, sleeping on the sidewalk. But it was lying in the middle of the sidewalk like it owned it. When we were passing it, my mother jokingly extended her leg, saying "Would you please step aside?" The dog woke up in shock, tried to escape but couldn't find a route through all the parked cars and attacked my mother instead. It grabbed her leg. I tried to scare away the dog but couldn't. The dog bit her leg. We rushed to hospital and she got a rabies vaccine.
