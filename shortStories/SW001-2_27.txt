I'm sitting, no, I'm half lying on the bed where my best friend is going to die. It was a treacherous hope. Now it's all over. The verdict was pronounced this morning in the November sunshine, in the pale, thin sun light. Is it my sense that he should be pale and ashen now? Is it my heart that urges for darkness, for the blackness of the night? I feel anger and powerlessness. Outside there is still the sunshine and quiet traffic noise, the daily hustle and bustle that urges agonizingly and sullenly into my feelings. Everything's disgusting. He wants me to go, let him die alone. He's not saying it. We don't talk. But the eyes say it and cut deep into my heart. I beg with my eyes. I hate everything, I hate this damn little gland that's been draining my best friend for weeks, that's been stealing his life. I hate the sunshine that shines on it all. I hate the world that keeps rotating like nothing's happened.
