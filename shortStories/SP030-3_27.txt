I can see Sabine. She's lying on her back. In the distance, I can hear footsteps; behind the wooden fence, something's creaking. A silent breeze caresses her face. Her foot hurts. Sabine can't see it beneath the grass. Her shoe is still hanging from the fence. When I see her face, it's a real shock for me. I feel dizzy. Sabine is pale, her face is white. She must be scared, but she looks at me peacefully with a little smile despite the pain. The footsteps are getting closer. I don't know what to do. A little snake weaves its way through the fence and disappears into the long grass. The footsteps are getting louder. The person must be behind the garage. The light over the windscreen is flashing. It goes silent. The wind glides softly and silently over us. There's a click behind the garage. A piece of metal is turning, making a noise. Sabine starts to yell. Suddenly, the two men are here. The stretcher makes a click when they open it up.
