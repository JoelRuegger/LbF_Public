I see her there, very close to me. My memory shouts to me that she would have put her hand on my shoulder whispering to me: "Be strong, as you always have been." This image she had of me, to always idealize me, I never understood. And today, putting her in the ground, I realize that this mystery will remain forever. To fix his tombstone ornamented with immaculate gold letters does not bring me any answer, my father will probably bring me no advantage. Yet he knows everything, everything about the trap in which my mother fell into, but refuses me any detail. But I saw him, death, freezing the face of this woman whom I loved and admired more than anything. I know that sooner or later I would find her killer, with or without the support of the police. I would shed light on all this history and avenge her memory. No matter what it costs me. I have but one goal in life ... this one.
