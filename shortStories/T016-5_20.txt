I was passing through the booths, behind the institute. It was too late when I heard the yips. Suddenly, I was surrounded by five puppies. They started to walk between my legs, yipping and nuzzling. Their attitudes and gloomy murmurs were not frightening but appealing. It was not hard to understand that they were hungry. I said "Sorry," like they would understand me, "I don't have food for you." The next day, I and my girlfriend brought them food and water. From their rush to eat, we could see that they were really hungry. We did this for a couple of days and learned their story from other people. Their mom had died a couple of days after the birth. Like babies, food is not enough for orphan puppies, either. Their hunger for care and love hurts them more than their empty stomach. We decided to push ourselves and we patted their heads and stroked after we fed them. They were happy. They disappeared in time. In the best-case scenario, I prefer to believe that they were adopted.
