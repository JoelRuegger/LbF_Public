That morning was the first in many years when I didn't go in to work. I had stopped work and, from that day on, I began a new phase that was completely unlike anything I had previously experienced. I could feel a morass of different emotions and sensations within me: on one hand the satisfaction of having liberated myself from all those daily tasks and worries, but on the other, a great sadness at the fact that I'd abandoned a project, one that had become a reality, and had grown and matured over the course of 15 years. A project I had always dreamed of achieving, and which had become not just a job, but a way of life, one which had helped me to grow at both a professional and a personal level. All that was over now; I had been forced to make this decision because of the financial unfeasibility of the project, and now I was naked and alone, with nothing to hold on to and with the uncertainty of not knowing what I would do tomorrow or in the immediate future.
