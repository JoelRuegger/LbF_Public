The morning we woke up to, a lovely, bright, warm April morning, made me remember a childhood event when we felt both sadness and joy. That morning we were still eating breakfast. We ran outside because of voices we couldn't quite grasp. People were yelling, "Call the fire department!" "How did it happen?" "Is there anyone still inside?" From all this yelling we heard someone screaming "My baby! My baby!" The neighbor's baby was left inside from all this rush. That moment we saw someone jumping through fire. That person was the lonely man who had rented the shop near the grocery recently and was a cold-looking person everyone was afraid to talk to. While all the townspeople were waiting in excitement and wonder, he walked out of the fire, holding the baby close to his chest. Everyone was so happy. That day townspeople accepted this man, later we learned his name was RÄ±fat. Now they were talking to him, ladies sent him food they had cooked. The cold-looking man was no more: he became one of us.
