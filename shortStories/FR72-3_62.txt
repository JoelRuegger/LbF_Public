All my life, I heard my parents tell me that lying was wrong. Having always been curious, one day I went to my parents' room, I was then 10 or 12 years old, I liked to wear my mother's clothes, especially her dresses, which with my small size gave me the impression of wearing a long dress, I loved it. But on that day, I came across a suitcase in which there were letters addressed to me: they were signed "your daddy J-C who loves you." I didn't understand: my daddy was called B. I took them away and hid them in my room. I read them all, one by one, all the letters that Mr. J-C had written for my Christmas, my birthdays. I remember crying but I didn't know exactly why. I am 24 years old, the letters have been in the same suitcase all this time, my mother and B. don't know that I know, and I dream of this Mr. J-C. I want to know who I am.
