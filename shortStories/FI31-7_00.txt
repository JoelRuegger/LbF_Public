It's my birthday, and I'm sitting in a restaurant with my partner and some friends. The atmosphere is cheerful, and the conversation is lively. I'm happy that nobody has to hurry off anywhere, and we have time to sit together and talk. The table raises a toast to my birthday, and I laugh when my friends sing “Happy Birthday” to me off-key. I'm so grateful for my friends and my partner. The waiter brings our orders, and some of my friends hand me their gifts. Delighted, I open the gifts and thank my friends. Finally, while we're eating our delicious desserts, it's my partner's turn to give me a gift. I feel butterflies in my stomach. I have been wondering all week what he might have come up with this time. I open the package excitedly. I cannot believe my eyes! In the package is a gift that I always secretly wished for. “Oh, thank you!” I shout in surprise and reach out to kiss my love.
