Today is the most beautiful day of my life, they said. I wake up and look at the clock: It's just past six o' clock. If I want to be on time for my hairdressing appointment at 6:30, I should get up now. But I don't have the drive, I don't have the desire. I'm so tired, so listless. As if my body is there, but my mind is somewhere else. I'm used to getting up early; it doesn't matter that today is Saturday. Out of habit, I get up like I always do. I get up and go to the bathroom, where I look in the mirror. In my eyes, I see an emptiness. I see what was triggered in me last night. It was the day before our wedding. We wanted to go to the lake once again, together, where the engagement was. It was the day I lost him because he was speeding in the car ahead of me. Because he lost control in the car ahead of me. And because he drove into the tree in the car ahead of me. Desperately I hit the mirror with my naked fist and drive to the lake. Because today is the most beautiful day of my life, they said.
