I'm at the gym in the middle of the day, and I'm glad that only a few other people are there with me. Now I can really concentrate on my exercises. I put my drinking bottle and towel on the rack and adjust  the bike saddle's height. There is music in the background, and somewhere, I can hear weights being moved around. I sit on the bike and start to pedal, having set the resistance to light, starting with a slow warm-up. I can feel my legs relaxing after a day of sitting at my desk. When my muscles warm up, I increase the resistance and start pedaling faster. I concentrate only on my legs' rolling movements and increase my pace. I lean over to get the towel off the rack and wipe my forehead. I roll my shoulders and neck and feel the tension slowly being released. I sip water from my bottle and continue pedaling.
