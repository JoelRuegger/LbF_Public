The story I'm going to tell you is something that really happened to me when I was 17 years old. While I was alone sitting on a bench, headphones in my ears, an old lady whose appearance was unpleasant approached me. In a few moments she took my phone and ran away. In a surge of panic, I went after her and shouted help to the people on the street. She stopped running and when I reached her, I did do anything, not being a person of strong character, but rather shy. Nobody helped me. I was terrified by this woman: she had made me totally weak and helpless. I was in a town that I did not know before to take a test. This person made me go right, left, I followed her, crying, not knowing what to do, until two men intervened and forced her to return my phone.
