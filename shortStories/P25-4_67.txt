That smell and that cold on my feet immediately transported me to the summer when I met you, to the house where all my life I spent my holidays with my grandmother. I do not know what I miss the most. I do not know what more easily slipped through my fingers, you, my adolescence, the days I never spent with my grandmother. Surrounded by voices and lights, I felt such a tightness in my chest that I could not contain the convulsive cry. The dark, bizarre sunglasses were no use inside the bar. Hiccups contracted my shoulders and tears fell incessantly. In a moment of lucidity, I hurried to clean them up. I had to push that suffering away, pull it out from my heart. I left the bar and ran to the beach. There was no better way to clean the soul than to take a dive in the cold and immense sea. The touch of the sand, its texture, took me back to summer, to your arms. But the heat shock I felt as I dipped my head was as violent as the one I felt when saying good bye to you one last time. It was hard. It was paralyzing. But as soon as I got back, I felt alive again. I got out of the sea and wrapped myself in the towel. It was not your arms, but it gave me the peace that you took away from me. There I was, watching the sea and thinking about how it related to us. It is beautiful. It is deep. It is free. It is over. Just like what we lived.
