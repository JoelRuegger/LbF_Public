I've had a very stressful day. I had to rush from one appointment to the next, I didn't have a quiet minute and even had to skip lunch. When I finally got out of my car at home, my stomach grumbled. With the thought of having to cook and wait even longer, my mood dropped to its lowest point of the day. But when I unlocked my apartment door, a delicious scent came to me. "Hello, darling!" My mother came up to me and kissed me on the cheek. "I was just in the neighborhood and thought I'd surprise you with your favorite dish. Come wash your hands and sit at the table." The fact that I was able to satisfy my hunger faster than expected and that I was able to tell my mother all about my strenuous day made me so happy that I hugged her furiously to hide my stupid tears of joy.
