It had been almost two weeks since I had last reached my parents on the phone. "Mom, how is life at home, I could not reach you, on TV, they say that the lines are less and less stable and that the satellites have transmission problems." "Your father has not left his bed, two neighbors are already ... whatever, how are you?" my mother asked, worried. "I'm OK, I'm hot, as many people are. Do you think that it's true, this story on the solar wind? A few boats have tried to cross; I can try to come back!" "No, stay safe, do not worry, we ... ... love â€¦ you." We had been cut off, and as I turned my head to watch the last TV in town that still broadcast images, I saw my country burning. The solar wind had reached the Earth and half of the continents were about to disappear. It was the last time I heard them, saw them, or my country.
