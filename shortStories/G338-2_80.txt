With pink tulips in my hand I walked along the gravel road. It was morning, the sun was shining in my face, and a hint of spring was in the air. As I walked to the usual place, I thought you'd probably like the flowers. Of course, I first told you how everybody was doing, that the exam went quite well last week and that only yesterday someone asked about you. That everything was fine with the house and Grandma was able to cope more or less with the situation. And that you're missed. Always. Since that day in August, the morning you didn't experience with us anymore. Again, I am overcome with the fear of forgetting. Forgetting what you were like, what your voice sounded like, and what you would have said if you were standing in front of me now. That's why I come every week to talk to you, in the wishful thinking that howsoever, you'll catch it and I'll stay in touch with you. So that you may remain a tangible part of my life. But the fear remains of completely losing you by forgetting.
