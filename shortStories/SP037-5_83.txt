At that time I was in my fourth year at secondary school. We played different sports in Physical Education, such as football, and they gave us an exam on it. One of the tasks involved keeping the ball up, bouncing it straight up on your thigh, 10 times, without letting it hit the ground. I was very clumsy and awkward, and so to pass this part of the exam I used to train wherever I could, whenever I could. One day, when I was wearing (fortunately?!) a miniskirt and tights, I shut myself away in the study to do my homework, as I always did. When I was tired of studying, I decided to practice the football exercise for a while. And so, with my short skirt rolled up to my waist, so I could move more easily, I began playing keep-up with the ball. I was concentrating so hard that I didn't hear my brother – who's three years younger than me – come home with his friends. When they opened the study door, I almost died of fright! And you can't imagine the expressions on the faces of those poor boys!
