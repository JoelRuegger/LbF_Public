When I woke up last Tuesday, I found a note that said: "Good morning, and happy birthday! I've prepared something very special for you. First of all, follow the arrows on the floor." I looked up and saw that there were chalk marks on the floor which were leading me to the room next to mine: the living room. I went in, and the chalk marks led to my CD player, where I found another note: "Press 'Play' and go to the bathroom." My favorite song began to play. When I reached the bathroom, I found the bath full of hot, pleasant-smelling water, with hundreds of little bubbles that seemed to be inviting me to climb in and never get out again. But I felt so curious that, as soon as I had washed, I put on the clothes that lay in front of the mirror and I found a small piece of paper that told me that now I was all ready to leave the house. Imagine my expression when I went out and found my girlfriend with my birthday present: a trip for two to a place we had always dreamed of visiting, and with our suitcases all packed. Could anybody wish for a nicer surprise?
