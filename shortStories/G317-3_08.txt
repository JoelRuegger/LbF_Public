I met you at this party. We got along incredibly well right away. In the end, I wanted to give you my number, but I had drunk so much that I couldn't hit the keys of your mobile phone properly. The next day you sent me a friend request on Facebook. I didn't recognize you, and I couldn't remember your name. So, I waited for a while, nothing was going to run away. A couple of days later, I came back to your profile. I Googled your name and found out that it was you. Excited and with butterflies in my belly I wrote to you and apologized for the unintentionally wrong number. A few hours later, I read the news: Student died at frat party. I started to research. I found out the dead guy belonged to your fraternity, that he was your exact age. I'm freezing cold. As if paralyzed, I read that the student bore your name. And again, I trembled so much that I couldn't even hit the keys of my mobile phone.
