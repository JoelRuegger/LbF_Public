It was a case of harassment in the workplace. For two years we experienced harassment at work, which took the form of being humiliated in front of customers and unjustified rebukes that had nothing to do with the job. At first, the workers stuck together, but later, gradually, a few people allowed themselves to be lured over to the side of the harasser. This situation left us ostracized from the group, and we gradually developed a feeling of inferiority and self-deprecation. This lack of confidence, together with physical threat, only grew â€“ he regularly forced us to wait until the last minute before he let us into the factory. Sometimes we had to wait in the car park, in our cars, for 20 minutes. Two years later, even though we no longer work for that person, we still avoid going past or even looking at the factory because of the bad memories and negative feelings that it brought us. Naturally, this process of harassment was accompanied by an increasing disparagement within our working environment.
