I'm walking in a forest, breathing in the crisp autumn air. The cold nights have turned the trees' leaves into beautiful shades of red and yellow. Some leaves already have fallen, and the wind has shaped them into big piles. I smile when I remember how we used to jump and play in the leaves when we were children. I look around, and on the spur of the moment, I decide to walk into a pile of leaves. I can feel the familiar rustling of the leaves under my feet, but I freeze suddenly when I step on something soft. It is slithering under my foot and I quickly pull my foot out. I take a couple of steps back, and I can see the head of a snake emerging from the leaf pile. Its long, slimy body soon follows the head. I gasp for air and try to back up, but the leaves make moving awkward, and I lose my balance. The snake's mouth is open, and its fangs are out. I stumble away, but I'm too slow. The snake already is flexing its long body and attacking. I feel a sudden, sharp pain on my foot.
