I'm swimming long distance today, and I'm already well into my training. My body has warmed up and is full of energy. The pool lane reserved for fitness swimmers is almost empty, as I want to concentrate on my swimming without other swimmers bothering me. I crawl forward with regular and confident strokes. My movements are already so automatic that I need not think about them and can just do them. I let the water flow around me, and  I concentrate on my breathing rhythm. I keep my pace steady because I want to preserve my strength to ensure I can finish my long-distance workout plan. Through the goggles, I can see the end of the lane approaching, and I prepare for the turn by turning my head to the side and taking in the last breath for the last time. I reach a good distance from the end and turn myself around underwater. I put my feet on the wall of the pool and push myself in motion. I dart forward and glide as far as I can before I start the slow strokes again.
