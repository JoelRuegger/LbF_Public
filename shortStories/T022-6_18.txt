It was a soft spring night when I went for a walk. While I was passing through a narrow path, I heard something, a growl and I felt a pain in my side. I looked around and saw a pack of dogs. I was very scared. My fear and anger continued for years. When I heard a dog bark, I said, "Oh no! they attacked someone." Time works wonders. My fear came to my mind every time I saw dogs. Years passed. One night, my daughter called me "Mama!" from our garden. She was holding a small black puppy. I said "Take him back to where you found him at once." I went upstairs. After a while, the sounds stopped. Next day, sounds were coming from the basement, I went down. They had put the dog there. I gave him a piece of bread but he couldn't eat. When I looked carefully, I saw scars everywhere. I did not like dogs but I could not leave him like this. We took him to the vet. He was male. My daughter said that his name was Tobi. The vet suggested that we should find a better, more majestic name. We choose the name of my husband's old dog. Lochers. Now Lochers is our friend, guard, baby and everything.
