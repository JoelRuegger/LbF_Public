I have just completed an endurance-training workout at the gym, and I intend to do a couple of weightlifting exercises before I leave. I walk toward the corner of the gym, to the abdominal bench. I put my towel on the bench and sit on the machine. I put my feet on the foot rest and find a good position. I still have some energy left, and I decide to do three sets of 15 repetitions each. I intend to rest between sets to settle my breathing and let my muscles recover. The first repetitions are easy, but soon my abs start to burn. During the last set, I must work really hard as the burning in my abs gets worse and worse. I struggle with the final movements, trying to maintain good technique, because at this point, it is getting harder to keep my technique together. My pace slows down, and my abs are shaking with exhaustion. However, I manage to finish all the sets.
