It's Saturday morning, and I awaken well-rested. I put on my slippers and get the newspaper from the hall. I then walk into the kitchen, turn on the coffee maker and start preparing breakfast. I cut two slices of bread, spread some margarine on them and cut  some cucumber and tomato slices to put on them. While preparing my morning sandwich, I think about today's events. I carry the breakfast to the kitchen table and open the newspaper before I sit down. First, I check the weather forecast. I hear that the coffee maker has stopped, so I return to the kitchen. I pour coffee into my usual mug and mix in some milk and sugar. I return to the table, sit down and take a bite of my sandwich. I drink my coffee while turning the pages of the newspaper, glancing at the headlines and looking for something interesting to read. I stop at a witty column. I take up a comfortable position in my chair, sip my coffee, and immerse myself in reading.
