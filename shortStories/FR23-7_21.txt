It was 6 am when I heard the phone ringing. I had a strange feeling, probably linked with the news I was about to discover. I quickly woke up to dash downstairs, because this call puzzled me. The noise I was making woke up the whole household even if I was taking care not to disturb the others. I then entered the biggest room of the house, the living room, to pick up the phone. It was Aunt Alice calling to tell us a very happy piece of news. She told me that a second little cousin had been born and that Auntie Jess, her mommy, had called her Dalia. After hanging up, I rushed upstairs this time, to tell everybody the news.
