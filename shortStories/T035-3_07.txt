I can't remember how we got in touch but somehow, I picked her up from home after work. It had been more than a month since we last spoke. She gets disconnected so suddenly. We decided to go to Kugulu: a new cupcake store had opened. I think I believed chocolate would lighten the mood. On the way, as an ice breaker I said "I will leave this place, find a dam construction and go and work there." I was bluffing. Even she doesn't mean it. I expected her to say, "Don't go, there are good things in Ankara too." She didn't say it, and I didn't push it. She was cold, sad and that bloody cupcake wasn't even good. Then I made another move, saying, "I will follow you until you hold my hand": she didn't respond to that, either. She brought me up to the top than pushed me to the ground so fast that I forgot about gravity and felt like I had been floating in the void. Then I left, not to a dam construction but to other construction in another country, far away from people. She jokingly said, "Why did you even leave?" She got married, I finished that construction, forgot to love. I have been waiting to crash.
