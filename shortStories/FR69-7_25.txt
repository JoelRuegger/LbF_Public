I remember. I remember six years ago, the journey that marked my life. We left, my parents and I, for a destination that was unknown to me, distant, which would separate me by ten thousand miles of my family and my friends: New Caledonia. We lived there for three years, and despite my reluctance, it was probably the most beautiful period of my life. I began my adolescence there, and learned what it really was to live. I remember being continually happy and filled with a thirst for adventure. It is undoubtedly this long but yet too short journey that forged the person that I am today. I constantly discovered new places, more like paradise than the others, and it never bored me. It is a country where everyone lives in a community, where the local population allows us to discover its culture and customs if we engage in conversation. Open-mindedness was perhaps the greatest lesson I learned.
