Is there a drug to appease me? A pretty powerful drug? Or a word to reassure me when I'm in a delirious phase? Could the comfort of a buddy or an attractive woman get me away or even heal me from a past that haunts me? I really tried everything to get away from a hectic life, gnawed, sleepless nights asking in a hesitant voice: Have I made the right choices? Cold and scary awareness. Sometimes I would fall asleep and wake up the next year. I enclosed the problems under a blanket of lead. When they rise to the surface, fear often paralyzes me. Then the anxiety strikes. So many times I have cherished my demons, for them to come back, to investigate without questioning me about the life I lead, if I take with me those crazy laughs, those memories of scenes. I neglected my family and even lost the girl I love.
