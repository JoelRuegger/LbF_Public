As I look at the sea, I wonder whether there are places to be when you are happy and other places to be when you are sad. And will it be that if I visit a place wherein I was happy before, this place will make the sadness that I feel disappear? I am not sure, I only know that, whatever my state of mind is, this landscape of sea and sky is the only one that acts according to sadness and joy. If I look at it sadly, its elements bring even more melancholy and, at the same time, if I am happy, the sea and the sky make me think of positivity, energy, and strength. At the table next to me, a gentleman is sitting. It is the same man whenever I come to this esplanade. Sometimes he reads a book, sometimes he contemplates the landscape as I do. I can say that we are the only regular customers of the esplanade. The others are new faces every day, the various feelings that appear on each face different. Each one feels their own way and gets depressed as they look at the horizon, thinking of an ex-love, for example, or rejoices as they sunbathe and look up at the sky, perhaps being proud of the walk they have just taken. I am glad that I did not stay at home. Seeing that I am not the only one has comforted me â€¦
