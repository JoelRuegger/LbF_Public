When I was young, I went to the seaside village where my sister lives for a vacation. It was a small town on the Karadeniz coast. Usually I spent my time with my nephews. Occasionally I went swimming with friends. Whenever we went to the beach, my sister got all tense. She wasn't wrong, Karadeniz shore is a dangerous place to swim. One day we went swimming, and didn't tell my sister. We had a great time at the beach, playing cards, dancing and singing. It was a fun day. Then some of us decided to swim: it was so shallow that we could walk in the sea. Then my foot slipped and I found myself in a hole on the sea bed. I couldn't release myself from this hole. When my friends realized the situation, they tried to rescue me but none of them was strong enough to pull me up. The water was pulling me deeper and deeper. One of our friends who happens to be a gym instructor ran to help from the shore: he grabbed me by my hair and pulled me up, then carried me to the shore. I still remember him lovingly.
