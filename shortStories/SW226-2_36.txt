It was a summer evening, our last evening of holidays with my aunt and uncle. Midnight had passed, the world was asleep, except for me, who was still surfing the Internet. It was a rather peaceful evening, perhaps even too peaceful. Suddenly my mother's phone started ringing. Worried by the late call and even more so as it was my grandmother calling, I woke my mother up and handed her the phone. I observed her reaction and tried to understand the few words I could hear. My mother's face distorted: she hurried to wake up my father and also my uncle and my aunt. My grandmother had said that my brother had not come home that night. I finally fell asleep, worried. When I woke up in the morning, I immediately felt something was wrong. Everyone packed their bags, even my aunt and uncle, even though they lived here. It was Dad who ended the tormenting tension when he told us that my brother had been murdered.
