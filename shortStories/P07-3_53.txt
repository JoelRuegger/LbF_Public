I remember walking to the window and seeing my reflection in the clean glass. I saw myself with my head tilted to one side, like someone with a bad neck, their trunk thrown back and frozen shoulders. I didn't like myself. The sound of your key in the lock left me with no air in my body. I heard the door opening. I heard you moving up. I stood in front of the window. I gasped. You were in front of the door. I opened the window. In one leap, I placed my feet on the window ledge and then I sat down with my body thrown forward. You came in. You were there, but, for a few seconds, silence reigned. 
How are you feeling today? That was the question you would ask me when you thought I was suffocating. At that moment, I only thought about how I now, proudly, could breathe in small, muffled spaces without thinking I would suffocate. Maybe because I already knew what it is like to almost die and did not want it. I gazed at you. You were closer. You were waiting, but I did not speak. Instead, my chest was shaking and my nose was burning. How are you feeling today? I looked up at you, I moved one leg into the room and then the other. I stretched out a hand to you and sobbed at the same time I tried to speak. Small, I answered, before letting myself fall into your arms.
