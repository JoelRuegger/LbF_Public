In the mid-1980s I met a really cool group of people. They were studying at art school in Barcelona, and they loved painting, music, and so on. They wore trendy leftish clothes and both the boys and the girls had long, straight hair. I loved their hippie styles, though I could never afford the type of clothes they wore. They rented an old house in Banyoles in summer, and I spent all my savings on staying with them for 10 days, although not of course without the inevitable struggle to get my parents' permission. I was 17 years old, I was a student and I had no income. I had a wonderful time there living the hippie life, discovering a happy world of smoke, alcohol, and sex. But my greatest discovery came just before I went home, on the 30th. When I got up, there was no one at home; they had all gone straight to the bank to check their bank books, to make sure that their mommies and daddies hadn't forgotten to send them their monthly bank transfer. That night I was home again ... fortunately, or unfortunately, I had little in common with those hippies: I belonged to the working classes and everything had to be earned through effort; less extreme but more honorable.
