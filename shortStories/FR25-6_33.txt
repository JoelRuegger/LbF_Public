1960, I was 15, I used to go regularly to the athletics stadium. Each time it was a great pleasure. Sport gives me a sensation of well-being. But the most intense moment is the day of a competition. Early waking, bus journey. Purpose: be ready for the race â€“ training, registration, numbers. I do the sprint. Start in 10 minutes. Time to place the starting block, adjust it, make a few starts, the heart starts to beat harder. The start is approaching, I take off my tracksuit, I jump on the track to get my muscles warm and ready. First, my body is shaking, concentration is at its peak, my heart is beating harder and harder. I am alone on the track, I forget the other lanes. Ready! My legs seem to weaken, I don't know if I will be able to move: Steady! My weight is pressed into my hands, I am no longer breathing. Go! All doubts are gone, I am running, I can only hear my breath.
