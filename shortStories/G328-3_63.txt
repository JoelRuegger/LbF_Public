After some consideration, I decided to start psychotherapy. I wanted to tackle my sadness, my self-hate and my problems maintaining a regular everyday life. I always had the feeling of being a bad person and I was very afraid to get this confirmed in therapy. But now I had found a therapist with whom I had built up some trust and we had sent a claim for reimbursement to the health insurance company. I got a message from my mother saying that I have to change my address for the health insurance company. She had received the confirmation for the therapy and opened it. I felt so betrayed, so exposed. I had the feeling that all my efforts were getting trampled. I could almost see my trust in the therapist bursting like a bubble of soap. I was so angry at myself, the health insurance company and my mother. My mother was very sorry, but I just felt lost and depressed and my mother's being sorry weighed down on me even more.
