Shortly after work I enter the supermarket, which is right around the corner. Because of it's proximity, I almost always shop here. The shopping trolleys are right next to the entrance. I dig a coin out of my pocket and slide it into the coin compartment of the next trolley. With a single jerk, I pull the trolley out of the line-up and find the shopping list in my pocket. The writing on it is almost indecipherable. I steer the trolley through the various departments of the supermarket and keep an eye out for all the items I need according to the list. Apple, milk, eggs, sugar and flour all end up in my trolley one by one. Many other products try to tempt me, but I remain steadfast and go straight to the checkout. I pay for my purchases in cash and head home to bake an apple pie.
