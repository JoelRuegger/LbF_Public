My favorite soccer team is playing today, and I'm sitting in the audience with thousands of other fans. The game has been painful to watch, as my team has been losing since the first goal was scored. Just a moment ago, my team tied the game, and now my body is excited in a completely different way. My heart is pounding, and I feel not only thrilled, but also hopeful. I chew gum nervously as my team fights on the field, and that same spirit transfers into me. In the final minutes of the game, my team gets a free kick from a good location. I exhale, clench my fists then open them. These are the crucial moments. I repeat cheers to my team in my mind. On the field, a player is preparing for a kick, runs toward the ball, and kicks. It's a goal! The audience jumps up from the benches and explodes with a deafening roar. We won! My team took charge of the game and won!
