I'm walking in the park, hand in hand with my loved one. It's a beautiful summer Sunday afternoon, and I feel relaxed and happy. We're in the park for a picnic, and we're looking for a place to settle on the ground and enjoy food and each other's company. We find a secluded spot under a big linden tree, and we spread our blanket under the tree. The place is perfect because the tree's shade shelters us from the scorching hot sun and curious eyes. We kick off our shoes and lie on the soft blanket. Our picnic basket is full of different delicacies: strawberries, cakes and sparkling wine. My partner pops open the bottle of bubbly while I dig out the glasses. We raise our glasses, smiling, and exchange a light kiss. I taste the sweet, sparkling wine on your lips. “What a perfect day,” I think. We lie on the blanket and curl up against each other. A light wind blows over us as we lovingly look into each other's eyes.
