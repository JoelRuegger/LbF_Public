I was going to teach first grade that year. When I entered my classroom there was one student who caught my attention. Mehmet was an energetic, loud, quick-witted boy. He learned how to write and read without scribbling a single sentence in his notebook. He was getting bored in mathematic classes. He said he didn't want to deal with small numbers. "What is 2+2=4?" he said, "Even babies can do it." Whoever I paid attention to in class he would beat them in the break. When I asked why, he replied, "Because you loved them more." We spent three full years with him, none of them boring. When we started our fourth year, I had sad news, Mehmet had fallen into the sea and drowned. He didn't know how to swim. I was devastated. But what I learned from his mother crushed me into pieces. Mehmet, who I failed to make write a single sentence in his notebook, a few hours before his death wrote a poem to read on the first day of school. When they took his body out he was still holding onto this piece of paper, which got torn apart. Years passed. Whenever a student brought me a poem, I always remembered Mehmet. Him and the poem he wrote for me but I was never able to read.
