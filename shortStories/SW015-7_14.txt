The Maldives are beautiful. I am sitting in a boat with a dozen fellow divers; in order to, in a couple of seconds, take the first vacation dive in the water with my dear wife. Slowly we glide down to a depth of 30 meters, where the dive guide takes us into a fascinating underwater world. We dive on a reef with medusas, corals and a lot of small colorful fish, as the guide signals us that we, the last ones still in water, should surface independently. Then he disappears and we have the sea all to ourselves when it suddenly gets dark. Baffled, we look up and see three huge manta rays which sail elegantly through the water and make a looping right in front of us. Wow â€“ every diver's dream has come true. This experience of shared joy makes me smile even decades later. Thank you, dear mantas, for this unforgettable moment!
