I was sitting and waiting for information. My heart beat so fast because I was so anxious and I could only think about how was it possible and how could I get there. The road that I took was hard and full of ups and downs, but, in the end, smiling is the only way possible to express what I feel. Smiling, because I fulfilled what I wanted most, what I fought for was achieved. There is still a little time to go for everything to happen, but what just came out is just the beginning of the best part of my life. "Whoever waits always reaches," and that is how I have been thinking all this time. In the end, the answer I wanted to hear, that "Yes," was said, and, at that moment, all I wanted to do was to cry, not out of sadness, but out of joy and relief. I know I will miss the moments I lived there, but I will remember them every day as if I were living them again. I also know that, when I tell those who I love what I went through, I will tell them with the greatest joy and the greatest pride and they will understand that the life I chose was the right one for me. I know they will be happy about my journey.
