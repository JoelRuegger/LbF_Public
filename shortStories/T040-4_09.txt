Probably the common thing when I look at all my childhood memories is that I can still feel the exact same things I felt on those occasions. There are a few memories I still remember but the one that affects me most happened when I was at kindergarten. My mom and dad dropped me to kindergarten as every other day. After some time, our teacher gathered us all in the playground and the doors were closed. Everything was normal for me up until this moment. Suddenly the door opened halfway, somebody was trying to enter while doing weird moves. Actually the one who was trying to enter was a clown who was here to entertain us. But his weird clothes and movements, even though I don't understand fully why, caused me to tremble in fear. I started crying, and naturally the clown tried to calm me while doing funny things. But it didn't help, I ran and tried to leave the room. Because of my reaction, the clown couldn't stay any longer and left without doing his performance.
