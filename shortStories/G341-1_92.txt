Two years ago, my cat Harry got very sick. When my parents came home from the vet, they told me that he had severe lung cancer and that it had already metastasized. I was incredibly sad and cried a lot. Sometime before Harry, my grandfather had a bad cough over and over again and was treated with antibiotics several times. I had this in the back of my mind when I heard about my cat. Not four days after my cat was found to have the disease, he had to be put to sleep. Shortly after the death of the cat, my grandfather's diagnosis reached me: Aggressive lung cancer. I was in a Voluntary Social Year at the time and had to go to a one-week seminar shortly after my cat died and my grandfather fell ill with lung cancer. I always lived in the fear that the very next moment I would get the news that my grandfather had died. Less than six months later, my grandpa died. I could hardly bear the fact that my cat had died like a forerunner, of the same illness as my grandfather a short time later.
