Throughout my life things have become better and better. After many sacrifices, what I most wanted to happen finally happened: I got pregnant. Having a baby is what I have always wanted. The feeling of having such a small human being growing inside me fascinates me since I got to know that we are not brought into the world by a stork. 
The morning sickness, the will to eat every and anything at any time ... even my weight gain makes me radiant. I am starting not to care about wearing excessively large clothes or about not always being in a cheerful mood. After all, 9 months fly by. If there is something better, or as good as giving birth to a child, it is the idea of being able to raise him along with someone who strengthens me and makes me see the world in the best way. Luckily, this is my case. He does everything to make me happy. He stays with me whilst watching the same movie over and over, he tries to satisfy my bizarre food cravings at four in the morning. I opened my eyes again after the waiter caught me by surprise and asked me what I wanted to have for lunch. I looked at the menu and did not think twice about choosing my favorite dish: steak with fried eggs, chips and an extra dose of cream and green pepper sauce.
