I try to sit as far as possible from my bus neighbor: he smells terribly bad ... Not a simple, pungent smell, not an ordinary cheese smell; no, a throaty smell, mix of rotten fish and dried vomit ... Hm, precisely, I observe it and this supposition seems to me more and more plausible. His greenish complexion and his foul breath suggest that he is not at his best. I do not seem to be the only one disgusted by this terrible smell. On the other side, a little girl is holding her nose. The bus takes a turn. My neighbor takes a deep breath, but it's too late. Stirred by a contraction of his abdomen, he vomits with force. His head is thrown back. He puts his hand in front of his mouth, but that is not enough to stop this yellow liquid. The lumps of his food slip between his fingers to find themselves on my knees. It's my turn to be shaken by spasms and rush to the exit.
