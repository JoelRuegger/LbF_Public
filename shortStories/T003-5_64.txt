It is a Saturday morning so I didn't need to set my alarm the night before. Sunshine is entering my room as I open my eyes. I can't help but feel joyful. To make sure the weather is nice and get some fresh air I want to open out my window. I can hear the birds chirping months later. Thinking we finally survived a long hard winter, I leave my bed and call to the others "C'mon, wake up, let's have breakfast!" I want to wash my face and start my bright new day. Maybe I'll go to a market to get fresh baked bread and eggs, some sausage if I can afford it. I check my pockets, but have no coins. Interestingly, I am wearing an outfit that has no pockets at all. I try to find my jacket but it is nowhere to be seen. I yell a few times, "Has anyone seen my jacket?" I don't know how many times I yell but I am determined to find it. Right at this moment the warden comes and with a voice that doesn't fit the beauty of the weather says, "You couldn't get used to it for months, I will not warn you again."
