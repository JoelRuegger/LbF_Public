I remember that moment as if it were yesterday. My mother came to pick me up from school, she brought me a snack, we sat on a bench, and she told me to eat up the snack as quickly as possible. She said we had to go home, and that I should wash my hands and my mouth properly, because we would be meeting lots of people who had come to visit us. Visit us? Why? What was going on? Was it a party? "No," my mother replied and, taking me by the hand, she hurried me along the street. Then, when we reached home, she hugged me and said that nothing was the matter, everything was fine. But even so, people were coming up, weeping disconsolately and saying to me "I'm sorry." It was a rather confusing situation, as I didn't know where my mother was taking me. All the way along the corridor, which seemed as if it was never going to end, there were lots of people, most of them dressed in black, by the door. I was eight years old and I was frightened of what I would see in the room. When I went in, my whole world collapsed, the person I had always loved and who had taken care of me, had died. Uncle, I dedicate these few words to you.
