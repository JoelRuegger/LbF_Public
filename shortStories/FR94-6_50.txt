I have been doing circus for three years in a small circus company. With my group I even went on a tour in Italy, we performed at campsites to vacationers who very satisfied with our show. After each show, people came to congratulate us and encourage us to continue. They said that our show and our energy on stage gave them a smile. At each show, my strength to do such physical things increases while keeping my smile. I am indeed very happy to know that it makes the audience happy. I like to know that thanks to us even for half an hour, the people who watch us are totally happy and share this intimate moment with me. This is for me the magic of the circus.
