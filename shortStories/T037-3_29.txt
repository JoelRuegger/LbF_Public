I was coming back to home from school. I was a little air-headed. There was examination stress but puberty was worse. The most important things were love affairs. I had someone with whom I was in love platonically. Those times, my only entertainment was walking around town to see her. That day I was walking aimlessly hoping to see her. When I stopped at the sidewalk to cross, I thought I saw her friend on the other side. I was looking around to see her too and got very excited. A bus was in front of me, I don't know if it was dropping or picking up passengers. I was waiting for the bus to leave so I could see it better. Then I felt an enormous pain in my nose. When the bus left my nose was hurting so bad that I couldn't care less about the things around me. I had stood too close to the road so that its side mirror hit me. I was so embarrassed and waited there a little longer while trying to hold the pain in. When I came to, I realized those weren't her friends and decided to go home.
