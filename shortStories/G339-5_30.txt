I open the car window a crack. My wife inhales sharply at regular intervals. I'd like to relieve her of the pain. Even the mental pain. "We're so young, can we even bear this responsibility?" she whispers. My throat closes. I put my hand on her lap. "Yes, we can. We're going to make it." I know that doesn't reassure her. I had imagined the trip to the hospital so differently. Happier, full of anticipation, with slight discomfort: after all, it is a birth. But so much discomfort? So much uncertainty? So much fear of the future? Down's syndrome. Why? I cast a quick glance to the sky. It's covered in stars. I breathe in the cool air and turn into the car park entrance. Nine hours later. On the horizon, the sun rises and colors it in a rich orange. There it is, the first scream. My heart beats faster, my emotions go crazy – there she is. Linda – the beautiful one. All the worries are gone, there's just the three of us.
