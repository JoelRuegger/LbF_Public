Finding a place to stay in the United States was an adventure, but no sooner had I boarded the airplane in Barcelona that  one of the last people I had contacted told me I could stay at her house. She was called Sophia. When I arrived in Michigan, she came to pick me up, she made me welcome at her home and during my first days at Ann Arbor, she helped me enormously in finding my way around. Sophia was clearly ill. She had lost almost all her muscular strength and there were some days when she was in terrible pain, especially when there was a lot of humidity. I never knew what she was suffering from, nor how serious it was, because that was the way she wanted it to be. In spite of the pain, she continued to live her life and always wore a smile. Last weekend, her health suddenly worsened. Neither she nor those close to her had expected it, but life can be very unfair. On Thursday everything got much worse, and then, in the early hours of the morning, Sophia died in her bed, surrounded by her loved ones. Just like she had wanted it to happen. To die at the age of 49 from bloody lung cancer! It was a bitter blow.
