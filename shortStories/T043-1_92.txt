Selim was my childhood friend. We were very close for years. We went to different schools but we were always together. After high school, we got separated. I came to Ankara and he stayed in Izmit. Our relationship got thinner but we kept in touch. One day I had a phone call: they said Selim was not fine, he was acting weird. I went to Izmit immediately. I wasn't sure whether he was happy to see me or not. He wasn't talking at all. I asked to go out. We walked. Once we were sitting, I asked what was wrong. He said they are following him, they are going to kill him. It was hard to convince him otherwise. I stayed with him for a few days then returned to Ankara. They diagnosed Selim with paranoid schizophrenia, and he stayed in hospital for a few days. Medicine was expensive and his family couldn't afford it. He got aggressive without his medicine. Three years passed. His family and friends were mad at him and I heard they got sick of him. One day I had another phone call. When he was alone at home, he opened the gas and let the room fill with it then he flicked a lighter. He was in hospital for ten days. I called but he didn't want to talk. He stayed in an ice bath for his burns. He died: I cried. What an unfair world.
