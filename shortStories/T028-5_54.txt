The first time I stepped on that stage, the effect I had on the audience was related to my motivation and dedication. If I didn't give myself fully during the practices or didn't attend them regularly, whatever I am doing, be it dancing, acting, etc., there would be a result, of course, but would that result actually be my best, or did I not push myself to my limits? Of course doing everything just OK is one's own choice, but for me it is disrespectful to the audience and oneself. Saying I did my best is easy, but trying is better: saying I have tried my best is beautiful. I might have tried but still been unable to do it, couldn't improve my performance: then it is time to bring out other areas I think I will be good at. I am aware that I am not good at every field, of course, but when I find something I am good at, I use it and try my best to make this moment memorable for the audience. Whatever you do on the stage you exist if you are remembered.
