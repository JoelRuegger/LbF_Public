A summer day. It's been three years since the circles around my vision turned to black from gray. My father's birthday. I wouldn't want to think of it as his last. We bought his favorite cake. Too hot outside: this can be a reason to pass the chocolate. There is a four-leaf clover hanging on my father's door. Like they are fooling a child. It will certainly create a panic if the light goes off suddenly in the hospital room. Even more if you are in the hospital for months, day after day, morning till night. I told the nurses, "Light the candles." I entered the room slowly while whistling the happy birthday song. He didn't have the strength to blow out the candles. I bent down: "you tell me, and I'll blow them out." "I love you so much." He fell asleep happy and smiling. I took a photo of the cake. My mom, sister and aunt were in the room. He left the hospital and started to fly through the sky. We celebrated my father's existence in a dark but starry night. Apparently, my dad liked stars so much, before a month passed, he waved at me from the smallest brightest star while the Moon was hanging in the sky like a big slice of orange.
