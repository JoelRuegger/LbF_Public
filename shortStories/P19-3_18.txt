I am angry at whoever made some days seem so long. Although they all have the same number of hours, there are some days that seem longer than usual. Today is one of them. As early as I woke up, I felt I should not have woken up. My legs hurt and I do not feel like dragging myself to the same coffee bar chair where I pretend that my life is good. 
The breathing of the man at the table next to me irritates me. It makes me dig my nails into the wood of the table and scratch it as if my nails were steel. Not to mention the noise that he makes when chewing that cake that he asks for every Wednesday. I can hear every detail of that man's digestive process. His mouth opening, his teeth grinding and chewing, his saliva mixing with the bits of food. It feels like my hearing has been amplified. Every little noise, imperceptible to other human beings, annoys me. It makes my brain boil, my feet jump constantly and my hands close in clenched fists. Involuntarily, I punch the table top whilst I shout at the man in question, "Can't you hear yourself?" He is perplexed. He does not utter a single word. He puts down the cup of coffee, the half-cake, pays the bill, and leaves. He never comes through that door again.
