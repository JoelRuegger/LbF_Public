It's a sunny day in the mountains, and I've just taken a ski lift to the top. The sky is bright blue, and the sun is warming my face. It's a perfect temperature for skiing. I stop for a moment to take in the wintry scenery. The snow-topped mountain peaks stretch toward the horizon. There are no trees at these altitudes, just some old, dead pines here and there. I see a ski hut at the bottom of the slope and decide to go there. The thought of a steaming cup of hot chocolate makes my mouth water. I push myself in motion and feel fantastically free when I slide down the slope. I first gather some speed, then make a controlled turn, which slows me down a little. My movements are relaxed and effortless. Powdery snow whirls behind me as I speed up again after the turn. I zigzag smoothly down the hill, the wind caressing my face.
