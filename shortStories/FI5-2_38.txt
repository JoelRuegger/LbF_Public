It's a bright wintry day, and it's been snowing heavily since the morning. The sidewalks are covered in snow because they haven't been plowed yet. There is a narrow path in the middle of the sidewalk, but it's slippery. The street is busy with people driving home from work. A woman walks toward me, and I step on the edge of the sidewalk to let her pass. I don't notice that the curb is covered with snow, my foot slips, and I lose my balance. In a panic, I wave my arms in the air and try to regain my balance, but I fall. My vision is shaky, but I see cars, white snow and black asphalt. I fall into the street, and as a reflex, I put down my hands and feel sand and ice biting into the skin on my palms. Car brakes are screeching, and I hear a woman scream. In panic, I try to get up. My heart is pounding, and my palms hurt. I raise my eyes and see a truck in an uncontrollable side slide heading straight for me. I get up on my knees, but my other foot slips again.
