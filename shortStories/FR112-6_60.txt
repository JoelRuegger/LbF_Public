The air appears cooler once this door has passed, this concrete trodden, this alarm deactivated. My free wrists shout their victory, and that phantom feeling of being hindered day and night will eventually leave me, I know. Their thin faces cut out of steel strips, I see them, far behind these gates, free, anxious, but impatient. Will they hold me to it? To have "abandoned" them? They are far too young to understand the fight that brought me here: maybe someday they will. My heart skips a beat when they shout "Mom." I then step up my pace as new locks bar the road, which the matron opens one by one. A step, and I will be free. One more, that of deliverance. When finally it is there, I cross it, the threshold of the prison from which I have just been released. My children are there, close by, and are already stretching out their arms full of affection; I am back, and all my love with me.
