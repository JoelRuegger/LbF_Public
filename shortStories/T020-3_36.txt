It was a quarter past eight when I started my day. The weather was great and the birds were chirping beautifully. I had my breakfast and started studying, but I was so caught up with it, I didn't realize it was already time for my lesson. I ran to class and made it in the last second. My friend came before me and sat down in the front row, and I had to sit down on the corner of the last row. I could hear the instructor's voice clearly but couldn't see anything that was written on the board. After too long classes, I was hungry. I met my friends and we went to the cafeteria, but it was everyone's lunch time and we were a little late because of our instructor. There was a long line in front of us. We talked while waiting in the line: when it was my turn to pass through the till, it gave the 'not enough balance' warning. My friends were already through. I told them not to wait for me and went to load my card, but the loading machine was broken, too. I left the cafeteria full of anger and returned to my dormitory.
