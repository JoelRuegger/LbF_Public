On my birthday, someone gave me a bonsai olive tree. It was lovely! I have a little garden with a few plants, and I thought it would do just fine in a little corner which gets the sun both in summer and winter. And so I put it there. I had no idea how to look after bonsais, but I thought that if it grew, I would plant it in the same spot where I had put it. I really liked the idea of having a nice olive tree, and I liked the idea of the olives even more! However, that year, during the winter, I was studying for some really difficult public examinations. I had to pass them, and with decent marks, or I would end up on the street. All my efforts went into studying, and it didn't occur to me that it was too cold outside for the poor bonsai. When the examinations were finally over and winter gave way to some warmer days, I discovered, sadly, that the poor olive tree hadn't survived the frost. I felt really bad about that.
