My conscience won't let me sleep. I'm lying on the bed with my eyes wide open and my gaze dead. It's been three days now. It's the third night that I haven't slept a wink. When I get out of bed, I almost collapse. "How can a man become so weak in such a short amount of time?" I ask myself. I carefully put one foot in front of the other and walk to the mirror. A cold shiver overcomes me as I see my own reflection. A broken man is standing before me. My face is pale. My eyes are red. My body is frail. It is not the first time I have thought of putting an end to my suffering. But I can't. My granddaughter needs me. She has no one but me. The thoughts of my granddaughter make all the anger come back. "That fucking bastard!" I scream inside. "He always stared at her. A girl of nine years old." In the neighborhood, there was a lot of talk about him. It was all true what was said about him. Now I knew that with certainty. "He shouldn't have touched her. I had to do it."
