I watch how trees crash down with the noise of a roaring motor saw. Birds flee from their nests. Nature is forced to retreat by the construction work. Where one tree falls after another, a golden hotel for the rich is to be built. Nature must give way. Especially because the building contractor wants to take possession of it. Just as he forces me to love him and obey him. He takes care of his beer belly and smokes one cigarette after another. He also carries a bald head and irksome squeaky boots. He likes to stub out his cigarette on the trees that are to be cut down because of him. For him, nature is a condition that needs to be eliminated. Evening after evening, he goes to the same little bar, just to grope the waitress there without restraint. She only allows this because she fears for her job. The man has her, just like myself, in his hand. Even if this hand is a very dirty one.
