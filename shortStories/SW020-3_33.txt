After dancing late in the evening, I drive my girlfriend home. On the way, she asks me if I have anything edible in the car. "Yes, sure," I say, "I have a bar of chocolate in my glove compartment; you are welcome to taste it." As I drive, she grabs the chocolate out of my glove compartment, breaks off piece by piece and eats it with pleasure. I am pleased to be able to do her a small service and I am happy to let her do it. Having arrived at the destination, she thanks me for the culinary enjoyment and mentions that she has never eaten this chocolate with chocolate sprinkles. I do not quite understand what she means and I think it is appropriate to inspect the chocolate. So, I turn on the interior light in the car and take a closer look at what is on offer. What I see exceeds my expectations by far: these sprinkles on the chocolate are little white maggots that spin and twist! Chocolate in the car has therefore become taboo since then.
