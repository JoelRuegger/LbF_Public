A good friend has an unknown but very serious illness. He's at the final stage, nearing death. I visit him often at the hospital. Nevertheless, it is always very difficult for me to visit him. I always feel very sad before the visit because I have the feeling that he is deteriorating a bit more every day. I am also very angry because I feel that the illness leaves less and less of my friend. I don't understand why it hit him, of all people. When I am at the hospital, I try to get rid of these negative thoughts so that I can cheer him up. But when I walk out of the hospital after the visit and take the stairs to the exit, I am relieved to leave the hospital on the one hand, but feel bad to have to leave my friend there, and I have to bear in mind that my friend will probably not leave this hospital alive.
