I have always been a person full of dreams, who loves to believe in the future and who thinks that everything happens for a reason. Ever since I was a teenager, I thought that I would at some point in my education go to study abroad. At the beginning of my second year, I began seeing other students asking questions about the Erasmus program, something that made me realize how much I wanted to study abroad. In December, the news came out that there would be an information session. In those two hours I only had two thoughts: bravery and fight. I wanted to go on Erasmus ... In March, I received one of the best pieces of news of my life â€“ I HAD BEEN ACCEPTED! In few seconds, a thousand things went through my mind: 1- My effort had been recognized and I was going to England to study. 2- Just forget, the scholarship will not be enough to pay for this. 3- You have to try! In September, when I stepped into the airport and finally realized I was about to fly away from my hometown, my family, my friends, and my country, for months, and to reach a totally different country, I was frightened. I was alone. As soon as I landed in Manchester, I smiled. I smiled like I had not done in a long time, and I thought about how lucky I was at that moment.
