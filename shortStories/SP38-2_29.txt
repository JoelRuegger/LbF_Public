They say that you have to suffer in love to know what love really is. But the fact is, nobody knows what pain really is if you don't suffer it together. Now I know: it's a pain that stabs you in the heart, over and over again, endlessly. Right now, I'm overpowered by emptiness; I'm no longer 'me': you took my heart away when you left, and you destroyed everything in your path. I have nothing left, I can't even breathe. The tears won't stop rolling down my cheeks; sleep and appetite have become strangers to me, as my old demons seize hold of me again. This game, our game, which was good for me, for us. You warned me that playing it so much, I might end up getting burned. But without the game I wouldn't have had the chance to discover what loving is, suffering completely, no longer fearing anything. You'll always be my first love, my strength, but also my weakness. At this moment, I've lost, I lay down my weapons, but I'm down on the ground. You've won, and I've lost everything.
