After lunch, my eldest daughter Laura, who is studying children's education, asked me to help her prepare something that she had to present. She had to tell a story to the class, and she wanted to show me how she was going to do it. She started with an introduction, telling the boys and girls that the tale she was going to tell them was her favorite story, and that it was very special for her, because when she was small, her mother had made it up, and she'd told her this story many times before she went to bed. I was amazed and didn't know what to say. I was really moved by the fact that my daughter had chosen our story, and to see how much it had meant for her, and above all that she wanted to share that memory from her childhood which had given her such happiness and a sense of well-being. Loving someone means that you do things without thinking whether you're going to get anything in exchange, although it's also true that when you receive acknowledgment for it, a feeling of inner peace flows through you that is absolutely priceless.
