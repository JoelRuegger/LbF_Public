I got a call from Maria. Earlier she'd sent me a WhatsApp to ask me to make sure that when we talked, my husband was there. My husband's an artist and I thought she wanted to buy some work from him, but when she spoke to me, everything seemed completely unreal. "I've got some really bad news for you. Something dreadful. Mike has committed suicide." "No! I don't believe it!" I said. She continued, sobbing as she spoke: "He couldn't stand all that suffering, and the idea of going back to school after the holidays just brought him to a state of collapse. No sooner had he come home, the next day, when he was left alone for a moment, he took his chance and jumped off the balcony. You know we live on the seventh floor. He died instantly." "Oh God, Maria!" "I arrived at the building and the police were outside, there were lots of people looking at the ground. All I can remember is seeing that the person lying there had blond hair. He was my angel." "Oh God, Maria!" Mike was 14 years old and it was only a week ago that we'd had dinner with his parents. My eyes filled with suffering. Why is life so cruel? I took a long time to get over that.
