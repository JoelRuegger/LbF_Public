It had all started four years ago, when I still thought that everything was perfect and that my life would go as I had planned. January 2013. I had arrived and was overwhelmed with the news that my mother had just lost her job. OK, it happens. We would have to be strong, be together and maybe something would show up. Worst of all, I was finishing the last year of my secondary science course when I was realizing that the chances of getting into the faculty were low. I saw my closest friends going into the faculty and I found myself in such loneliness and sadness as I faced the fact that I had got left behind. I have always loved sports and I have played federated tennis from a very young age. It had always been like this until the summer of 2014, when a relentless pain in my right knee came. I was forced to give up on my great passion and my great cure for sad days. There were doctors again and again, examinations again and again, medical appointments again and again ... It was inevitable. The most I could do was a simple 20-minute walk. I had to find another solution to get rid of these thoughts of uselessness that invaded me every day and would not let me sleep at night.
