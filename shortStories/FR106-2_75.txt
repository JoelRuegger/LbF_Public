On an ordinary day, I was in my kitchen preparing spaghetti Bolognese, when the police rang at my house. As I watched them come through my garden gate, the worst possible unimaginable things flashed into my head, and an inner narrative never ceased to repeat "what do they want? but what could I have done?" Suddenly they knocked at the door and while apprehensive of opening the door I trembled and wondered what they would to announce to me. My body was filled with chills, fear, and anxiety as, as best I could, opened the front door. The news they told me was such a shock that I lost my balance, and everything surrounding me went black. When I came round, the police officers repeated their speech in cold blood, and suddenly I burst into tears. I was henceforth alone facing life without my grandmother and the words "all my condolences" resounded like a dagger deeply embedded in my heart.
