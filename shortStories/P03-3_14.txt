I always liked the amusement park. I love going to the haunted houses and being scared by the actors there, though I find their attempts a bit amateurish. I created my first haunted house when I was 12 years old. I painted the walls in red, hung up sausages, and put eggs decorated like eyes inside the fridge. My haunted house must have been immensely realistic as, when my neighbors called the police complaining about the stink, the cops would not even come to the doorway. They called me outside and asked me where my parents were. I told them that my parents had gone on holiday and that I had been living alone for about a week. So the officers took me to the police station and asked me some questions. A few hours later, they took me to a large house full of children. I stayed there for two years, until I decided to create my second, and so far my last, haunted house. Now I am in a white cushioned room. I cannot paint the walls, I cannot get sausages, and, even if I could find eggs, I would not be able to decorate them.
