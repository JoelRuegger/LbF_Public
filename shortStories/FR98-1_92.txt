It was a Saturday morning, when I learned that my little cousin had been sexually touched by a family friend that everyone knew very well. When I learned it, it was a mixture of sadness for my cousin, because it is my family and family is what is most important in the world, disgust because it is unimaginable to think someone can do something like that, even less to a child of seven. There was also this feeling of hatred, because people like that are garbage. The most frustrating thing in this story is the fact that my little cousin never sleeps alone, has difficulties in school, skin problems, has eczema from head to foot that she cannot get rid of. This trauma will remain engraved in her memory and we her family are there to watch his misfortune and can do nothing, only to see him escape with just a three-month suspended sentence. It's horrible: he's ruined a life.
