The place is the MEB Sports Hall ... Me and one of my best friends, Cem, have a match against our old club. I could not play in the match because I injured my heel in a stupid match before. I wanted to play this match so much that I cried when my friends took their position on the court. We had a good start and took the lead. At half time, we went to the locker room in advance. When the team returned from the locker room, we had the same opponent but a different referee team. In the very beginning, we could not get how our two coaches were sent off without reason. Twelve teenagers, 15 years old, felt like fish out of water. I was running to the hall, taking our coach's commands and conveying them clumsily to my friends. There were players who had cramps, who injured themselves to get the ball. Unbelievable motivation. I haven't seen such a dedicated and connected twelve players. The match nearly came to a draw but for our coaches and ourselves: we pushed our limits and won the match. In the end we were so happy. It was an extraordinary youth match. After that we saw that referee team four times and they conducted the matches appropriately.
