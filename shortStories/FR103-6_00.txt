Today, as usual, I went to the animal shelter. However this time it was the decisive moment to become a volunteer. Initially my goal was to take information, so on my arrival I thought of only that. I was shown the premises, the various volunteers already present and their activities. I saw them wash the dogs and I accompanied them on their walk in the nearby park. On my return, I met with the leaders, secretaries and other members of the association and ended with the marketing director who gave me a speech on the importance of my mission and the need for me to invest in the animals and for their good. The manager insisted that it would take a lot of love and affection for the animals and it was then that I said to myself that later I would have my own animal shelter.
