My name is Caroline. I have a sister to whom I am very close called Florentine. Despite our age difference, we are extremely close. We share a common passion for horses. So we spend most of our time together. Today, as every day, I went to school, but in the late morning I got a call from a number that I didn't know. I picked up and a voice said: "Mademoiselle, are you Florentine's sister, we have terrible news to tell you and it is very difficult." I felt my stress levels rise and said, "What's going on?" The answer was like a stab in the heart: "Your sister just had a car accident and she succumbed to her injuries." In my head everything was clouded. I didn't know what to say, I collapsed to the ground and burst into tears. Nothing worse could happen to me. I am capable of only one thing, emptying my body of all its tears. I just lost half of myself.
