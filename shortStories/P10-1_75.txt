At times, I spend days without seeing the sunlight. I lock myself in the darkness of my room and do not get out of bed, not even to eat. Today is one of those days when I see no reason to get up. I do not have the strength to face the day, but I have to do it. I have to go to school or my parents will punish me. It is not worth pretending that I am sick because the last time I did it, my mother found out and now, even if I am sick, I have to go to school. I already know what the day is going to be like today, I will spend all my time on the verge of tears, wishing for the time to come quickly for me to come back home, to my refuge. When I get to school, I meet my friends. I greet them and sit near them. Although I have many friends, I always feel alone. I feel empty inside all the time. They are talking and it is like I am not there, only my body is. My head is completely disconnected from the world around me. I am on autopilot. I do not think it is normal for a teenager to cry constantly because she does not want to get out of bed and do something. Something wrong is happening to me and I am afraid of what it might be.
