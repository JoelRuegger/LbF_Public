I know that you are waiting for me at home. We haven't seen each other for two weeks, and I've missed you terribly. I've waited for this moment all day, and I run the final steps to the door. When I enter, you greet me and hold me without saying a word. We fall into a long and passionate kiss as you take me into the apartment. I don't care about taking off my coat or shoes because I cannot think about anything else but you. We grasp each other tighter and kiss passionately. When we step apart for a moment, I can see your eyes glowing. Your smile makes me smile, too, and there is a warm feeling inside me. We fall on the sofa, and I feel your lips on my neck and on my face. You smell good. Your warm hands touch my hair, my face, and the back of my neck. “Oh, how I have missed you,” I think to myself. I grope at your clothes passionately, and we're both out of breath.
