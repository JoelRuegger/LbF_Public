When I was a little girl, one day I was having a party with my mom and her friends. I went down to the cellar to get drinks and that's where I saw blood on the floor. I looked at where it had come from, and I saw it was a wounded weasel. I quickly took the drinks to my mom. Then I went to look for a doll's bed in my room to keep the weasel warm. I took in the first aid box to cure the animal. As soon as the weasel was cared for, I went to show it to my mother. My mom said to put it out because it was horrible and disgusting, and she was too busy talking to her friends. I was not happy. I went outside but I felt sorry for the weasel because it was raining and there was a storm. So I hid it in a cardboard box in my room. A month later my mom was cleaning my room while I was at school. She saw the weasel, she began to scream and I never saw the snout of that animal again. I was really sad because I had become attached to it.
