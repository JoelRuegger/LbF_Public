It was my first time going abroad. We would visit Vienna. Since it was summer I only brought shorts, t-shirts and such; I didn't bring any pants or raincoat with me. We had a friend who would meet us in Vienna and show us around Budapest and Prague. We landed in Vienna and met our friend, then went to Budapest. He took us to a lake, and said "The water is cold," and we could put our feet in it if we wanted to, and he did it. When none of us seemed to want it, he came to us and insisted that we should, then I went and put my feet in. I was wearing sandals and the moment I put my feet in they filled with salt, I tried to clean them. Then I realized not only salt but also lots of moss had stuck to my sandals. It was both hurting my feet and smelling so bad. I mean, the smell was so bad that we couldn't keep my sandals in the hotel room, I kept them in nylon bags which I shut tight. I started to wear flip flops. But from the first day it started to rain and didn't stop until we left. So, I traveled around Vienna in my friends' shoes, wearing my boyfriend's pants.
