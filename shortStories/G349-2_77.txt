One summer evening I was jogging along my favorite track in the forest. I don't know where the dog came from, I just felt a sudden jolt and severe pain in my right leg. Yanked so suddenly out of the running movement, I fell forward and heard a terrible cracking noise. That was probably the breaking of my left arm, which I fell on with all my weight. The fall didn't bother the dog. He continued to grip my leg and kept shaking it vigorously. I was lying on my stomach and couldn't see the dog, I just heard his threateningly deep growl. I was paralyzed with fear and horror and could not defend myself despite the pain. The dog dragged me several meters, until the owner arrived and got the dog to let go of me with several blows. I don't remember what happened right after that. My scars and fractures have healed in the meantime, but today when I hear a sound which only remotely resembles a growl, the sweat of fear breaks out.
