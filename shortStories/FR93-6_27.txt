This morning I got up with a ball in my stomach. Apprehension? In fact this morning as every day I got up and I confronted my fear. The fear of facing the world and trying to overcome my terrible shyness. Yet every morning I get up again and again. Because this world that we sometimes find painful simultaneously offers the opportunity to discover ever more beautiful things, as simple as they can be. So it is from the slightest smile, the slightest look, the slightest exchange with a stranger, a friend, family that I draw my strength to advance day after day. That is why tomorrow I shall rise with the same ball in my stomach and I will continue to offer you my sincere affection so that it buds in you the same happiness that invades me sometimes and grows when I am with you, my family, my friends and even you whom I do not yet know.
