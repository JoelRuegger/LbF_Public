Where am I here? It's dark and damp. A basement? What was that? Somebody's screaming. A long, wailing cry. As if he was in pain. There it goes again! Am I imagining this or did it really sound closer? And what was that laugh? It sounded like it was enjoying the suffering. I'm scared. Where am I? Maybe I should go see where the voices come from? No, certainly not. I've seen enough horror movies. That would be my sure death. Oh, God. There it was again. And even louder than before. Are they coming my way?! No, no, I'm getting all paranoid here. Come on, move and find an exit. But quietly. Otherwise they'll hear me. What would I give for some light. Ouch! I don't even want to know what kind of puddle that is. It feels warm and sticky. I still have a lighter. Shit! "That's blood!" "Yes, and it will soon mix with yours." "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"
