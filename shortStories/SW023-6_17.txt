I am only 10 years old when I ride with my sister over the Sankt-Alban-Bridge in Basel on a scooter. We drive on the sidewalk and directly to the left of us we see the cars in their own lane. Out of carelessness, I suddenly fall to the ground directly onto the car lane, where the cars are moving at high speed. Now I'm lying directly on the road and I see a car approaching, which frightens me enormously. I can't get up fast enough to save myself. But something unexpected happens, my legs are pulled straight up and the car rushes past me without touching me. Without this reaction, it would have run over my legs. I get myself onto the sidewalk as soon as I can, into my sister's arms. My reaction is certainly due to my guardian angel, which is why I (now 55 years old) would like to dedicate these lines to him in gratitude.
