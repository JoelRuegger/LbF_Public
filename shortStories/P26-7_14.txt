I could barely hear the voices in the distance, but I recognized immediately his whistle, that sound that reminded me that I could not sleep all day long or that it was time to go home. I was covered in sand and the itch on my back was unbearable. It had been a good day, though I almost drowned in those huge waves and almost got lost in the middle of so many people. But it had been a good day. I was starving, but I knew that, in a minute, I was going to eat something. No one treated me as well as he did. If she was around, it would be even better. His constant attempts to make her laugh made him take advantage of my excitement. After half an hour in the car, to the sound of 80s rock, we got home. There she was ... beautiful, tall and always smelling so good! I do not know which one of us likes her better, if it's me or him, but the truth is that I do not know who she likes best! We are a family, or we will be ... someday! She gave him a kiss, he gave her a kiss, and I did not let myself be left out! He made a disgusted face, she let out a laugh. We went in and they sat on the couch! She wanted to see my new skills. I sat down, I rolled, I pretended I was dead. She took out a cookie from her pocket, and let out the long-awaited "GOOD BOY" It was for me! I was the "good boy"! I am small, but I am a good boy. Their "good boy"!
