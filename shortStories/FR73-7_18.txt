My skin relaxed and warmed, like when we stretch naked in the sun, in the middle of summer, after swimming. I surrendered myself to this delightful sensation. I bowed my head, took a deep breath and closed my eyes. I felt wonderfully well, as if I were drifting in a pure and fresh wave, except that I was immersed in the light. Soon a strange exaltation overwhelmed me, my mind suddenly united with all that was around me in an intangible and timeless bond. I was at one with the trees, grass, insects and animals, without forgetting the air and the water ... I was no longer an isolated being, but a harmonious part of a whole. The connection that existed between beings and things appeared to me in a new light, my own person seeming to me both insignificant and omnipotent. Seeing the world through the eyes of all the creatures around me was disconcerting, but wonderful.
