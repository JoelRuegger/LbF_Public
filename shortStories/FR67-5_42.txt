I was a very active young woman; I couldn't help but go out every weekend to go shopping, visit museums, and stroll downtown. Staying locked up at home was not for me: I hated it. When I was younger, when everyone was laughing at my first name and how overweight I was, I had become used to isolating myself from the outside world and stayed cloistered at home. But now I have revenge to take on life. I have become stronger and I am no longer afraid to leave my house. I even have a few friends whom I see from time to time. Yesterday, a Saturday with beautiful weather, I could not get out because of the homework I had to do. I expected to catch up today. Opening my eyes this morning, I was all excited: I had planned a boat ride. But my pleasure was short-lived. When I opened my shutters, I realized that there was a storm.
