I don't know how it happened, but there were only two of us left in the classroom. Whether it was planned or not, we found ourselves talking for ages. The voices coming from the hallway were drifting away. The silence must have affected us too: we had run out of words. I was playing with the pencil case, turning it right and left in my hands. My eyes got away from Nilay, like they were trying to avoid her. I fixed my stare outside of that ugly looking window to the branches of a tree which were moving harmonically with the wind. Did I have the courage to look at Nilay's face? "No way," I thought. I tried to take a deep breath without her noticing. My chest was bumping in an irregular rhythm. My face got all red. I started to turn the pencil case faster. My stare left the branches and fixed on the pencil case I was playing with. Time had stopped. I wonder what I planned to say, but the thing came out of my mouth was, "I, I lo-ve you."
