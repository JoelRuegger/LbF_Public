Finally, the time has come: the two-week skydiving course in beautiful Ticino begins. After a lot of theory and practical parachute packing, the day finally comes to get up in the air. So far, we have laughed a lot and encouraged each other. But now it's got serious. We're in the middle of a climb. Somehow now everything is different than expected. I look directly into the fearful face of Mario, who immediately infects me. I've never seen Mario with such frightened eyes before and I can think of a thousand reasons why I shouldn't be here right now. Then he jumps and I see it turns him right on his back – the worst thing that can happen! Now it's my turn – I jump ... black out ... I notice how the glider slows me down and come back to my senses. On the ground I ask my instructor: what happened? He says, "Sensory overload, everyone has it – but we never tell them this in advance, otherwise the fear is even greater.
