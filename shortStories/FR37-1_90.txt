I met a man at a party: it was love at first sight. We decided to live together several months later and considered family life, so we decided to have a child. I got pregnant: it was the best day of my life. On the other hand, after 6 months of pregnancy, I learned that I had cancer. I did not have much time to live if I did not make a decision on my care. All my dreams of forming a family collapsed. I had no choice, but I had to make a very hard decision: treat my cancer and therefore be unable to keep the child in the face treatment that would have deadly repercussions on him, or not undergo chemotherapy and resist until the end in order to be able to bring my child into the world. I chose to say nothing to the one I love and to offer him the most beautiful gift that could exist in exchange for my own death.
