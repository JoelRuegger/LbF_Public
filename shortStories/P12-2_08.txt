From time to time, I feel so sad that I do not want to do anything. Nausea overcomes the silence and causes me tremendous discomfort. Discouraged, I end up not being productive, which causes even more frustration. I do not call my mother. I want to avoid the shame that she feels about me, that we both feel about me. But I blame myself for not calling her, and the isolation that holds me in such an open space grows. Loneliness possesses me and controls me. The jostling of people on the terrace is an affliction of intersecting worlds. They confuse themselves and confuse me with constant restlessness, almost without letting me breathe. I get up and put down the only money I have so I can resume my walk. I get a dizzying sensation. Someone stretches a hand to help me. I am on the floor and the others were aware of it before me. And how I hate that they offered to help me. The anxiety and humiliation are suffocating, like ropes around my neck. I leave the esplanade almost running, looking for a refuge. I cannot find one. I sit in the shadows. I remember I am in mourning, but I cannot remember why. I realize I am hearing rumblings of voices, but there is no one around me. Two hours later, it starts raining.
