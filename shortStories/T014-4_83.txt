I will tell you a story which I love so much. I really don't know how much of it is real and how much is fiction, but I can tell you this is what remains of the best days of my life. Those were the times that winning and losing still didn't have meaning, times when I didn't care about past, the future, or even the present. It was not long ago, one or two summers ago. Actually, I am not sure how many years passed. I was high, far away from all this. The only thing I felt was love. Maybe the reason I thought about it so much afterwards was the 'nothing else matters anymore' mood I had. I didn't listen to him. He was saying how could we live separately if we merged with each other so much. He was right, but it was too late. I already saw her, myself actually. I had a happy life living with him far away from this place and time. Maybe it wasn't me, but it looks like me. When nobody is perfect in my universe, in a parallel universe she was living a perfect life with a man I – or maybe with the man she was in love, I don't know – was in love with. It wasn't a dream: it can't be.
