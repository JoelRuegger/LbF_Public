I like to sit down at the same table in this café, to take my notepad out of my pocket. I like to write about the taste left in the cup by the person before me, about the others or about me. Today you are the topic. I do not know your name yet, but I have the right word to call you: Happiness. I appreciate your subtle approach, like someone who doesn't care though is willing to stay and have coffee with me. I ask your name: "I want to call you by your proper name." "My name is João." At least, that was what he replied, full of expectations about what would happen next. I asked him to come with me. We left the café, and, although we knew that city like the palms of our hands, we stumbled into it at random and lost ourselves. We gave our names to known streets, we counted the steps toward the sun and we realized why all this is called happiness. 
We toasted to the feeling that ran through our bodies, joining our hands as we walked, and we smiled. We smiled as if tomorrow did not exist, as if tomorrow we would not be together at the same coffee table.
