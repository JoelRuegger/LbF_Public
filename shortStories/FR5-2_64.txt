He is facing me, I only see his black eyes and his gun on my forehead. An electric blast goes through my body, from my toes to the top of my skull. Drops of sweat are going down my back, my mouth is dry, my heart rate rises and I feel the fear paralyzing me. How could I have imagined this morning when I woke up that my day would take this turn? I could have started at the butcher, or the fishmonger, but no, here I am, in this grocery in the center of town, with this guy holding me harder and harder. It is 11:46 and my life is about to end. He screams, forces me to the countertop, my legs barely supporting me. My breath comes faster and faster and jerky, tears are rolling down my face, fright can be read on my face. Everything is blurred around me, and it is hard for me to hear his words. "The cash or I shoot her dead!" are the only words I perceive. When the gunfire sounds, the world around me freezes, and I collapse.
