It starts quickly and too strongly. The vibrating changes into jerking immediately. I sit on my bed, looking up from my diary, at the ceiling that floats back and forth. The plaster crumbles to the ground. I understand what's happening, but I can't move. Where's Pablo? He wanted to write an email to his family. The wall of the house breaks down and I see the people running into the street. Run! Down the stairs. Through the door â€“ it's blocked. The other one! Out. Someone takes charge. Everybody with a car here, everybody without one there! He's not there. I run through the crowd. Pablo? Where there were houses, there's nothing left but rubble. I get pushed into one of the cars. My gaze is toward the outside. The quake doesn't stop. And Pablo is nowhere. From a distance, you can hear a helicopter. The car stops. A little later, we get in the helicopter and take off. My eyes are stuck to the ever-smaller people still on the streets in the shattered city. Then I see him, looking after the chopper.
