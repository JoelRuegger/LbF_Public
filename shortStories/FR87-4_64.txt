A few months ago I had a fall from a horse. The firemen rescued me, and told me I should not move. So I understood that something abnormal had happened. On arrival at the hospital, after examinations, questions from doctors, waiting ... the verdict came: a fractured vertebra. As I realized what was happening, the anguish began to rise. I was told of an operation or a corset. I had to make the choice quickly. Following the advice of the surgeon, I accepted the operation. Worried, I was then taken to the operating theater, where a very strange universe appeared before my eyes. I fall asleep, entrusting my body to this doctor. When I woke up, I didn't know if the operation had gone well or not, but I didn't feel any pain. A few hours later, the surgeon reassured me and told me that everything went well. Determined, I re-learned to move and walk, despite the difficulties that this represented.
