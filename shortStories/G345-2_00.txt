I looked at the shiny linoleum floor. I had already walked over it countless times, run over it in panic or stood on it trembling. But I never noticed it. It had been my constant, unnoticed companion for the last two months in hospital, and my daughter's as well. It was also the only one that had witnessed her fight with leukemia in its entirety. Often the only one who was there when she awoke from twilight sleep crying because the cancer made her bleed from a new orifice. I fixated it with a stare as if it could take away the nagging doubts that struck me on this unspeakable day. It could never forgive this lack of grief, I thought. There was little left to do in the next few days. The grave would have been reserved long ago, the priest's call would have been a mere formality. What would I do with this impending void, now that I don't have to stare at the life indicators at the sickbed day after day? I stepped through the squeaky front door onto the asphalt and thought of death.
