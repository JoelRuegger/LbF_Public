Autumn and pleasures. I enjoy a hike: Pleasures for the senses this morning, pleasure for the eyes this trip, while nothing is decided yet, and I walk in the sunny undergrowth. What surprises will there be on this beautiful day! What do I see there? What makes me think nature has awoken? What aroma do I sense? Could you imagine it? Under golden leaves chubby, well-wrapped and completely hidden, five pretty porcini mushrooms, kings of the forest, were hiding. I start to dream about my dinner: Oh beauty, oh the beautiful dish! Well-colored, probably well-packed, but the great feast of my hike, well exceeding my expectations of my morning. Not only did I look at my trophy, I admired their layout, I guessed their velvet feel, I already smelled my beautiful plate in my old fireplace: in short, my eyes were almost imprisoned by such a beauty born on a morning of such a lovely day.
