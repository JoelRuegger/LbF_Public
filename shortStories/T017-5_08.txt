Sometimes I feel like I am homeless. I cannot accept the place I spend my childhood as home. I used to, but since I came to another country for my education, I lost this concept entirely. Of course rather than accepting this, it was easier to wait for holidays with the desire to return home, pretending I still had a home. And on that day, when I reached my parents' house before ringing the bell I realized I had returned but I no longer belonged there. The vacation ended, and I returned to school as always. I tried to ease my anxiousness by working on my school projects. About that time, we started to meet you occasionally. I remember. "Do you want to grab a coffee?" "Have you ever been there?" "What do think about this?" simple but still special. I got used to the fact that I wanted to see you more than the other guests in my life, then the feeling of being home when I am near you. Sometimes I really feel like I am homeless, but surprisingly this feeling I associated with you eases my worries. I am at home now.
