I open one eye, and a bright blue sky invites me to rise quickly. I stand up: the lake is in front of me, more beautiful than ever, with ducklings walking behind their mother. A memorable night, spent under the stars, contemplating Orion and the Great Bear. With one bound, I get up to go and prepare lunch on the rusty camp stove. I prepare a coffee to refresh my ideas. Our camping trip is almost over. We have only to put away, in Jerome's old sky-blue Mustang, all our bags and camping equipment that my father let us borrow. We clean our grandfather's ground and I get in the car, passenger side, as always. After changing the radio several times, I hear Caliente. I stop my radio station quest, because I like this song. We begin to sing, I let myself be carried by the music that warms me and by the wind coming in through the window that refreshes me.
