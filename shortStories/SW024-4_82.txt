As a girl, I was looking forward to a sports festival, especially because a paraglider pilot was supposed to land. Finally, it was 3 pm and I saw the paraglider flying high up in the air. We kids loved it. But soon the paraglider was forgotten. When I remembered that the paraglider was still supposed to land, I looked up to see if I could find him. He was already on his way to the sports field and the pilot's legs were about 1 meter above me. I got scared and started screaming and running away. However, in landing, the paraglider pilot continued to fly over me until he hit the ground after having pivoted to the side. My parents first thought I had been stung by a bee because I was screaming so much. But I was panicked and I would not be appeased. Up to this day I can't look up into the sky when a paraglider is flying around.
