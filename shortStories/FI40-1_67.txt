I'm spending the night with my family. We have just finished dinner, which my mother prepared, and I'm glad that the atmosphere is relatively relaxed and happy. My father sits in his chair, quiet and pale, and even though he has been like that for several months now, I still haven't become used to it. Tonight, everybody is trying to forget recent sorrows and instead concentrate on each other's good company. After the meal, we get up and start carrying the dishes into the kitchen, chatting in a very cozy atmosphere. My father gets up to wipe the table, even though my mother tries to stop him. I'm taking the big pot to the kitchen when my father slams his hands on the table to get support. My father gasps for air and coughs. I quickly put the pot down on a side table and run to my father. He clutches his chest and falls to the floor, unable to breathe.
