The priest thanked me for coming to the funeral. "No children, the distant relatives didn't even know him," he explained to me. The community had paid for the funeral. No one had come. I hardly knew him, either. The man had been my neighbor for the last five years. He also seemed to have had little contact with the other house inhabitants, only in passing they greeted him without obligation. Occasionally he had played a Beatles record loudly, otherwise he was never noticed. I had noticed that no music had been heard for a long time. I only knew his name from the bell sign: I saw it written out today for the first time. Somehow, I was afraid we might have the same first name. I promised the priest that I would visit the grave occasionally. A few months later, I come back from work in the evening. I'm annoyed that the neighbor's girl is still taking piano lessons. I demonstratively turn on the radio. All of a sudden, I'm ashamed. I'd already forgotten him. I am crying. Eleanor Rigby is playing on the radio.
