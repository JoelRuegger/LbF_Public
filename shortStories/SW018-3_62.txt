My dear wife and I are in Bangkok, it's hot and dusty and I'm carrying a 2-year-old child on my arm. Our goal: The Childcare Residence at the Sukhumvit, a 10-km long road. We have to register our newly adopted child there. We stop a taxi driver to take us to number 3465. Soon we're at our supposed destination and are looking for the building. Then we find out that we landed at 11224 and therefore decide to go to the destination on foot. After a felt hour of walking we reach number 7563 and decide to take another taxi. The next driver assures us that he knows the destination and so we drive to the mentioned place. Soon we'll realize that we've landed at 4877. After another 30 minutes of walking we finally reach our destination, bathed in sweat. Later we learn that the taxi drivers judge the house numbers only by feeling or find them unimportant. That still upsets me to this day!
