My name is Elodie Durand, and I have always had an ambition since I was little to become independent and free. On January 1st, 2015, this day becomes reality: in two weeks I will go on an adventure with my two childhood friends, our goal being to open up the world, to discover other cultures. I want to rediscover the true happiness that presents itself in the moment, far from all the distressing banalities imposed on us by society. I want to go far away from this consumer society, its new technologies, far away from individualism and the total dissatisfaction of human beings. I was not made for this society, where we are condemned to act according to societal norms. I wish to control my life and act according to my desires: my destiny is in my hands, and if it is necessary to provoke destiny, I will provoke it to arrive at my ends.
