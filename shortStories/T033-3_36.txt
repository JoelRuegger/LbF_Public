It was a cold evening, and we were playing card with friends at Keçioren, Uyanis. There were fewer of us than usual. Then suddenly we saw a group of people coming out of the unfinished construction and walking toward us. We were looking at them and each thinking what should we do. Because we knew that this group was coming to take revenge after one of our friends stabbed someone unnecessarily. We were not related to any of it but somehow, we found ourselves in the middle of it all. They outnumbered us and they were armed with knives. After a little delay, we started to run. After running down the hill we jumped onto the dam. Since the attackers were not from our town, they were unfamiliar with the environment and tried to follow us from the road. All the neighborhood went outside due to the rumble we caused. And there happened the Malazgirt War. The attackers were chased away by the Uyanıs Neighborhood. We didn't realize how tired we were or where we had hurt ourselves while running due to the excitement and fear. Even though we laugh at it now, it stayed as a fearful memory.
