The theater became silent. I could feel my frantic heartbeat as I stood next to the stage; still hidden from all the people, but soon to be in front of them in the glowing light. Like a rising sun, the stage lit up bit by bit. The music would start playing shortly and then ... I'd dance. Dance – and everything around me would stop existing, except for the melody and me in it. The music began with a dark tone, rose and made me vibrate. I felt charged up. My thoughts raved, my heart fluttered – then the beat began. And suddenly everything was completely quiet. As if in a trance, I moved from the shadows into the light of the stage. I turned in the flow of the music. It was supernatural. It ruled my soul, blurred everything else. My body moved by itself, completely absorbed by the sounds and the forces that swayed with them ... Then the music fell silent, me with it in the last movements. The light died. And with the darkness the clapping of the hall invaded me.
