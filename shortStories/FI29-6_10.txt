It's a quiet night, and I don't have much to do. I sit on the sofa with the remote control and click through TV channels. Tonight, I want to be by myself and take it easy. I end up watching a sitcom. I never followed the show, but I've seen some episodes here and there, so the characters are vaguely familiar. The show seems entertaining, and I relax. During a  commercial break, I click through other channels. I stop for a moment to watch a documentary about Northeast Asian tigers. It doesn't interest me enough, so I continue clicking, coming across a Finnish drama series, a movie and a news show. I decide to return to the sitcom just as the show returns from commercial break. I take up a more comfortable, stretched-out position on the sofa and continue watching the show with the remote in my hand.
