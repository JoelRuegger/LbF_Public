My roommate isn't one of those guys who values cleanliness and order. He leaves his dirty clothes everywhere, never rinses the dishes and I don't even want to start with the stench that comes out of his room. But what he has achieved today caps it all off. We both spent the Easter holidays with our parents, so our apartment was empty. My roommate left one day after me and I came back one day before him. As I entered our apartment, a penetrating smell of decomposition wafted toward me and the air was filled with fat, humming flies. The moron had left an open pack of minced meat standing in the kitchen in summery temperatures! And even with the window tilted open! When I saw this teeming mass of decomposing flesh and the white maggot bodies, I vomited into the sink in a flood. I'm staying at a friend's place tonight. I'll leave the cleaning up to the "fly breeder."
