It's a summer day, and I'm on a hiking trip. I'm well prepared with a map, compass and flashlight. I also have a half-eaten snack in my backpack. I hike along the familiar paths in a national park, and every now and then, I check the map to make sure I'm headed in the right direction. Sand rattles under my shoes, and the pine trees around me emit a fragrant scent. After hiking a while, I decide to turn back and re-trace my steps. I want to get home without having to walk much in the dark. Luckily, summer days are long, and I know that I have several hours before darkness falls. As night falls, the shadows become longer and the birds stop singing. Suddenly, I need to use my flashlight to check my map, but using that and the compass, I easily find the right path, so I pack up my aforementioned items and continue.
