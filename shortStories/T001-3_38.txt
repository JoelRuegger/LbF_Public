I am watching her from a distance. As if it is not enough that she broke my heart, she is chit-chatting with that guy. Like you're testing me. And I am trying to make conversation with this girl for you to see. I asked whether you would talk to me and you didn't even answer. I can't listen to this girl near me from looking at you, but you don't know that either. You probably don't care what I do, who I am talking to: you said it's over this morning, and that's it for you isn't it? That guy is flirting with you right before my eyes and you don't even look at me. This girl is trying to flirt with me, too: at last she asks me if I have a girlfriend and I tell her to go and ask you. She goes to you and asks: you say no, it breaks my heart. She comes back to me with a smile. I continue to talk with her. He puts his arm around your waist and you leave together. As you leave I hug this girl and watch you walk away behind her hair. Even though you are far away, I can still hear your laughter.
