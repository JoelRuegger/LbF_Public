My volleyball team is playing against a difficult opponent, and the game has not been going too well. I try to concentrate, even though I can feel frustration and pressure throbbing in my head. My thigh and shoulder muscles hurt. Our opponent is leading the match, and I know that we need to turn this game around soon, or we'll lose. Our  opponent is putting pressure on us with their serves, and they try a strike. At that moment, an opposing player prepares for a jump. I take off toward the net and jump into the air almost at the same time as my opponent, who hits a fantastic strike. I reach out, straining my upper-body muscles, and manage to defend against the attack. I did it! A feeling of relief runs through my body when my feet touch the ground. I saved my team from an embarrassing loss. I walk back to my place, sweat running down my face. My closest teammates pat me on the back. This is exactly the game-changing move we needed to win this match.
