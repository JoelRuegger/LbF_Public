Although my eyes were fixed on the screen, I was seriously focused on the sunset behind the bar. The sky was on fire and I had not seen anything like it in a long time. 
I wiped my face with one hand and stood up. I ordered a fresh water to take away and decided to go home. You were almost back from traveling. Finally. At home, I shook out the rugs, I opened the door for the dogs to go out, I lowered all the blinds and I put the kettle on. Without thinking, I followed the routine that marked your absence. I looked at your photograph and smiled shyly, as if you were watching me. There was something about the way you looked at me that made me laugh. Always. The dogs warned me of your arrival, I leaned forward toward the window and peeked, stretching my neck as much as I could. I grabbed a shawl, put it over my shoulders, and walked toward you. You smiled at me from the car. I waved. It was warmer than before. You kissed my forehead and looked up for my hands, making ironic jokes about how you had never felt them so cold. I grimaced and turned to open the door. The dogs entered first and we entered right next, just before the kettle boiled. The sun burned and tea seemed like a silly idea, but, as you used to say, there are several ways to keep the heart warm.
