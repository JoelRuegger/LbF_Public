I was lucky enough to do my mandatory internship in a firm that offers a minimum wage. The firm said that we would get our payment at the 5th of each month. So, I decided to offer my friends a meal on the 6th. I told them we would spend my first salary together, and that made them very happy. On the 6th, we prepared: a friend picked us up with his car, seven of us including my girlfriend and I, to go to a restaurant. We ordered almost everything on the menu, tasted everything. Even so we ordered dessert (which is a rare event for a student, unless you are the child of a member of parliament or such like). We ate until we are completely full, then asked for the check. I gave my credit card to the waiter, entered my PIN and waited. The waiter said, "Sir, not enough balance." I was shocked: "How come? I just got paid, try again," and he did, but again not enough balance. All of us paid our checks separately, and if that was not enough, they even had to pay mine, because I had no money. Later I found out they weren't paying the interns.
