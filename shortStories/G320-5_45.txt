December 24th, 1985. Yesterday I climbed the cathedral with you (up to the top). You were overdue. They threatened to induce me after the holidays. I wanted to face that on this beautifully sunny day. There were numerous descending tourists: one of them also seemed to be pregnant. We touched each other, belly to belly. Stuck. No escape. No progress. She coming down from the top, me going up from the bottom, with you in me. We looked at each other, laughed at once, detached the bellies skillfully from each other in spite of the abundance and waved us further up or down, under the amused giggle of the following people. At the top, Thomas, you and I enjoyed the grandiose view of the free imperial city with its surroundings. We could even see the Alps. That same evening in the cinema, we felt the signs for the first time. Barely were we at home when there was another one and still another one and another – Thomas raced with us, stormed into the hospital elevator with us: NOW! The alarmed midwife pushed us into the delivery room, where – wham, bam, thank you, mam – you were born on Christmas Eve in the early morning, already strongly manifesting.
