Why did you take what was mine, and then go off like a thief? He never should have done that. The smell is still here, the reddish color penetrating the ground. He should never, ever have done that, he had no right to do it, I was only 10 years old. My mother stands in front of me with a knife in her hand; she doesn't judge me, she takes me in her arms to protect me from this monster who wants to take my childhood from me. I'll never feel like smiling again, or even want to live. You can't grow up with what we suffered during our entire childhood; either someone saves you or the damage is done, since long ago. I can smell something burning, but I remain motionless in the car, as my mother starts the engine. We leave. I don't know where we're going, or how long we drive for, but we drive. And so we travel through entire cities, chasing all those men who are so evil that they attack innocent souls, whether it's in the street, at school or in the family. We will bring these people justice, whether they are women or men.
