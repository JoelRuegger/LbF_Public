I want to talk about love. It gives me a sense of wellness. Is it only the fact of loving, or that person by my side? Love, friendship, presence, sharing, admiration is a whole that gives the impression that everything else is futile. We feel invincible, indestructible. It's an incredible feeling. I would like to be in that state for the rest of my life. Love is not always easy to live with. It can be sweet and bitter; it can rhyme with happiness as with unhappiness. I think the present moment has to be savored. Every day, I measure the chance that I have of being with this person: she makes me grow, accompanies me in happy moments as well as in difficult moments. Love is grateful, I am grateful for this happiness, this wellness and this continuous joy. We must learn to receive but also to give for the sole pleasure of benevolence.
