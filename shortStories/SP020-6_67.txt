I was very excited because my football team had reached the final of the King's Cup. It was the first time this had happened in the club's history, and neither I nor my friends wanted to miss the match. We bought our tickets on the day they went on sale, and we managed to get tickets for three seats together. We were so excited! The day arrived, and with it all the preparations for the big event: the sandwiches, the scarves, the flags with the club insignia. We even painted our faces in the team's colors. The stadium was amazing, and each team's fans were yelling with all their might. How exciting! But the most exciting thing was the match, because the other team scored first, and it seemed impossible that we could score two goals. But our shouts of encouragement seemed to have an effect, and in the end, as if by magic, our team scored twice and won the cup. We were overjoyed, and we celebrated noisily, both in the stadium and then later on outside it.
