The day was almost over. In my thoughts, I recall it in my mind. I took a detour and walked across the fields bordering the country road. In the distance, I could see a small forest. After some time, I reached a pasture, which was about halfway between the country road and the small forest. On the pasture there were two horses, a big black one and a small brown one. One grazed further to the back of the pasture, while the other one stood at the fence next to a cart track. They both seemed to be ignoring me. At the end of the cart track there was a car with an open trunk. In the back of the car were various brushes and other horse-care utensils. A middle-aged man, apparently the owner of the horses, got out of the car and greeted me. I talked to him for a moment and then continued on my way home.
