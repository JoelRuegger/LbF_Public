I stepped on the slippery floor, freshly washed, when I came in. It reminded me of the many times since I was a child that I had been to that café. My parents chatted happily with their friends while my younger brother and I ran after João, the son of my parents' friends. One day, the coffee lady had just washed the floor near the bathrooms but we did not notice. We ran in that direction and I ended up slipping and falling. The two of them stared at me, perplexed, not knowing what to do. When I started laughing, they did the same. We laughed so much that day! Coming here reminds me of all the good times I have spent here, the best moments of my life. But it was also here that my brother and his wife decided to give us the news that they were going to be parents. It was here that João asked me to marry him. Coming here always makes my day better. It is for this and many other memories that my brother, João, my husband, and I still come to this café. We no longer run or slip, but we still have great discussions and arguments. We laugh and we get angry. And, in an uproar, our children run down the esplanade, which has the same breath-taking view.
