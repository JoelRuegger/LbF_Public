There I was, inattentive, going down a narrow and dark alley, when I started hearing voices. The more I walked, the louder they became and the angrier they sounded to me. Sensing a possible threat or just being a coward, I stood behind the building before turning to the corner and peeking from there. There they were: two homeless men, ahead, arguing under a large cardboard shack, lined with brown bedspreads. They both were dirty, ragged, and shaggy; only one was visibly drunk, and staggered, cursed, and flapped his arms with an empty bottle around the other, who was sober. Apparently, the drunk demanded that the sober one should leave the shack, but he refused. Then the drunkard, in a sudden blow, smashed the bottle into the oily head of the sober man, who fell on top of the junk, stunned. I just wondered where the police were. Then the sober one, still conscious, got up with effort and, at the same time as the drunk came back for him, got a penknife and stabbed him in the neck. Afterwards he removed the blade and left the drunkard, spouting blood all over the place, to fall on the junk. Soon there was a brownish-skinned dog that began to move around. He snuggled close to the body and he began to moan softly. And there they were under the shack.
