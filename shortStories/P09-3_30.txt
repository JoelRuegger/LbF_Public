Since I gained weight, I cannot look myself in the mirror. Before I became obese, I suddenly lost my safe haven, my boyfriend. I found that he had left me for someone better than me, more beautiful, more elegant, more intelligent, more everything. Food and the television became my refuge, I left tennis, I stopped going out with my friends and slowly moved away from all those who were close to me. I lost everyone but my mother. She is the only one who stays by my side, and fights for me every day. But I lack the will to be better. I feel unable to make an effort to remedy this situation and go back to who I was. It is very painful to do that with the amount of nasty comments I get when I leave home. People are so unfair to me! I feel like coming back home. Everyone in this caf√© is staring at me and judging me as if I am trash. My mother tells me to ignore it and drink the rest of the juice. Sometimes I have melancholic thoughts and I wish to end my life. I feel that the world would be better off without me and, at least, I would end my suffering. I stumble across an amazing view. Everything seems so peaceful to me, as if everything is achievable. I almost have hope in myself. Almost.
