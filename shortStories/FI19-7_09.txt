It's a sunny summer day, and I'm at an amusement park with my friends. The atmosphere is light as we laugh the time away. The rides and game machines play their tunes, and you can hear joyful screaming and laughter here and there. We decide to ride a roller coaster, and we line up for the next ride while chatting cheerfully and eating our final puffs of cotton candy. The cars finally rattle toward us, the safety bars rise, and the previous passengers get out. Bravely, we choose the first car. The roller coaster smells like old wood. The cars begin traveling through some mellow turns, with a few small climbs, then we start our ascent toward the highest point. The cars lurch upward, and the city spreads out beneath us. I laugh and sigh in awe. What a scene, and what a fantastic wind! The first steep descent looms. We inch forward, closer and closer to the drop. I grasp my friend's hand and laugh. Here we go! My stomach turns as the roller coaster cars dive. Thrilled, I scream and throw my hands in the air.
