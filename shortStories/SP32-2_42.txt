Sometimes, when I listen to Clara talking, and when she tells me how tired she is, I begin to feel scared. Clara often says she could easily slip out through the window; that she'd like to leave it all behind. She's got two children, and they try not to cause her any problems: they don't take drugs or drink, they're easy-going and studious. They're grown-ups now, and they try to find time to be with her. They listen to her without dismissing what she says, without criticizing her thoughts. And when they don't agree with her, they try to make her understand in as gentle a way as possible. They don't want to be nasty or to hurt her. She's had enough setbacks in her life. She says it's not her fault. They think the opposite, because sometimes, when she's talking, what she says suggests a lot more than you might imagine. When she starts recalling times in the past, her children suddenly feel afraid. But they don't dare say that to her because they're scared of upsetting her or making her angry. She carries on talking in spite of their woebegone expressions. Maybe they also feel partly responsible for her sense of unease.
