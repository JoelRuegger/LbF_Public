I can still remember my first job interview. Needless to say, I was extremely nervous, even in the days leading up to it. I tried to prepare myself as well as I could, trying to think what they might ask me and what I should know about the company so as to give suitable answers. Then I spent ages trying to decide what to wear, in order to make the right impression: should I wear this shirt, these trousers, these shoes or those ones ...? Every little thing was a fresh source of stress for me! When the day arrived, I was a quivering mess. I had hardly slept, I felt extremely tired and my mouth was dry. My hands were sweating and I didn't know where to put them. When I went into the room, there was a woman interviewer and a man whom I presumed was one of the company's bosses. She was very nice to me, trying to make the situation more relaxed. But my mind went completely blank when she started the interview speaking in English. Why hadn't I thought of that? I'll never forget it for the rest of my life.
