School's over. I'll never see my friends there again. They're watching me go. I step through the gate and close my jacket, because the wind is blowing past me and I start to freeze. I'm thinking about persuading the woman from Child Protective Services to let me stay. But my surrogate mother doesn't like me. Nobody at home likes me. I just was a little happy at school. My real parents gave me away as a little baby. I feel all alone in the world. I'd like to run away, look for a new family and never feel as an outcast again. At that point, a man ran past me and knocked me over. Ouch: I fell on the cold asphalt. I sat up and fought back tears. Desperately I opened my backpack and looked for my teddy bear. Oh, no, I forgot about him. My Stupsi was still at home on my bed.
