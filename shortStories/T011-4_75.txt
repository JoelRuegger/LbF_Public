It is a summer evening. We are sitting by the table as a family. This our family rule: everyone must be at home at dinner time. My father is a retired soldier. Maybe this is the reason I am fond of rules. Whenever I want to break a rule I feel like something is dying inside. Like my life will change dramatically and I will drown in my own vomit. Foolish isn't it? I think not. Despite all this, let's go back to that summer evening. I wandered idly until dinner time. Played games, snitched fruit from the neighbors for fun. When the day was over I was starving. I went home and sat at the table. The soup was served, and on the other side of the table was a plate full of melon. I fell in love. And that day for the first time I broke a rule. I reached for melon at the start of the meal. I had to stretch too far: the dear melon decided to land in the middle of my soup bowl. A matter of decision, of course. Feeling blue. The melon regrets it, too, but too late.
