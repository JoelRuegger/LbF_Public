Nostalgia. It's raining and I'm just sitting here. A thunderstorm has been going on for days. The storm rages outside â€“ and inside me. My parents don't see it. "It will soon clear up and all will be good again." But how can I explain to them that it is raining, even when the sun shines, that it pelts down, even when there is not a breeze. How could they understand that I miss you, even when you're next to me? And now you're gone. Go! But don't forget me. Put me gently into the bitter past, but never forget me! Remember me when you fall in love. Remember me when you're so happy it hurts. Remember even when everything goes wrong and you don't know what to do. Because I'll remember you. I hope you're happy, there where you are now. And I hope the sun shines every day. It's raining here and I'm just sitting here.
