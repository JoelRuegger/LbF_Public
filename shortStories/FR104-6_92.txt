I am of Cambodian origin, I like mangas, the Korean series, Thai, Japanese and everything related to Asian culture. I am love traveling and not just for fun but to meet different cultures, different people from me. All my life I only wanted one thing and on my 25th birthday, I received an envelope with a plane ticket for a tourist trip to the cities of Asia. Imagine my surprise when the city of my origins appeared in front of my eyes on this small trip dedicated specifically to the cultural activities that were proposed to me. My head was turning in all directions, I felt myself going so far that I could fly up there in the sky among the great white birds. My life would finally change to become thrilling, full of adventures, fabulous, intoxicating stories. Internally, I saw life in pink, but my cheeks looked like red tomatoes.
