Last summer, my boyfriend and I spent two weeks traveling around Croatia, and we visited the families of three friends. Their mothers were all excellent cooks, even though they did give us too much to eat. It was virtually impossible to eat everything they served us. It was all excellent and home-made (the bread, the pasta, and even the noodles for the soup). A normal meal included soup, salad, meat (at least two types), sometimes rice and then fruit and little cakes. At least five different types of home-made cakes. And then they brought out the chocolate with the coffee. In the end, we were worried that it might seem rude if we said we couldn't eat any more, but we decided to be proactive and do something about it. And so, after a particularly copious lunch, we went to brush our teeth. It seemed to be the perfect plan. When they asked us if we wanted anything else to eat, we replied to our friend's mother, "No, I'm sorry, we just brushed our teeth." But with a broad smile, she just said, "Well, you can brush them again afterwards." And so we gave in, admitted defeat and went on eating.
