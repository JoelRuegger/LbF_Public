My best memory happened shortly before my birthday. I was playing handball at a high level. I was 14 years old. That day, it was the qualifying match for the French Championship. My coach came to me proposing that I played this match, this qualification. He trusted me, letting me play in my favorite position. He told me that he was not going to let me play the whole game, since I was too young compared to my opponents. In fact, I played three-quarters of the game. In the stands my father looked at me with eyes and a smile I had never seen before. I knew he was proud of me. My coach and supporters were screaming for me to score a goal because of my age, my height and my build-up against my opponents. These screams gave me a strength that allowed me to score, and to get my team into the French Championship. This day will remain the most beautiful of my life.
