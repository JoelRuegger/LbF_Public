The sun burned and the line of the horizon blurred between the sea and the sky. I half-shut my eyes. I realized I was thinking of you. Among some ideas that crossed my mind, I promised that, as soon as I saw you, I would tell you that I missed you. I swore to give you a kiss and a long hug, because I like it and because I need it. I also thought about cooking for you, in your house, as I had said a long time ago. So you would keep still, looking at me in your kitchen, opening and closing drawers as if that space would already be mine. I would try not to break anything. However, I would not swear, for I was born clumsy, and I could possibly break a crystal glass, like I did the last time. On the other hand, I would know that, even if I did something wrong, I could look at you with a very serious face and blame you, whilst I would hear you saying yes, taking the blame just to please me. The sun burned. I opened my eyes and smiled as soon as I saw you arriving. I got up and waved, still in the same place, because you were walking toward me. I wrapped my arms around you and laid my head on your neck. I felt myself comforted by a hug with the right tightness. I then felt your smell and it warmed me inside. It felt good, and it seemed only right to conclude that, at that moment, I was feeling at home.
