It's an ordinary Tuesday morning in the office. I'm sitting on my office chair in front of my computer and am waiting until it boots. Then I hear a gentle ping. Like the sound of the proverbial pin falling to the ground. It's not a pin, it's a paper clip. Where did it come from? I don't have any paper clips anymore since I switched my office to paperless. I eyeball the utensil and I don't know why I'm doing this. It's a simple paper clip. A small piece of bent metal wire with which you can hold sheets of paper together and later loosen them again. I wonder who invented it. How did the inventor come up with the idea? Did they just think of it that way? The inventor must have worked on it for a while. Maybe even years. Was is his life's work? If so, did he get any credit for it? Maybe I'll get to the root of it sometime. Someday. But not now: now, back to work.
