I was sitting against a wall, alone. The others were playing, walking, running, but not paying attention to me. No one spoke. From time to time, someone gave me a slight smile; others looked at me with an air of pity. But most of them avoided looking me and ignored me. Another day, when I was still sitting against this wall, another boy came to sit next to me. He was well-dressed. He began to talk about everything and nothing. It had been a long time since anyone had come to speak to me: the only words that had been addressed to me for a long time were insults or mockery. During the discussion, the well-dressed boy explained that when he was a child, he was often alone, sitting against a wall. The adults were looking for other children to talk to him, as they thought that the other children were cruel to leave him alone. After 10 minutes, he left, leaving me changed and promising to return to this wall tomorrow.
