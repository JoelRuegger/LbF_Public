The weather was getting colder, indicating that winter was at our doorstep. The cold was saying, "I will break your motivation." I was walking to the cafeteria. I was alone that day, aiming to eat my meal as fast as I could and go back to my room to study. When I reached the cafeteria and looked to see what the meal was, I was like a kid watching the shelves at the toyshop. Compared to the days when the cafeteria did not treat us as human beings, the meal was good today. Then I saw it: they were serving baklava today! The food was OK, and there is baklava: I got in line immediately. I waited impatiently for the moment I reached my baklava. They were serving three pieces to each student. The line was moving and the baklava was getting shorter. I finally reached it. There were only four pieces left. They put those four pieces on a plate, so as not to serve a student only one piece. Then a box of oranges came out. In front of my eyes, those baklavas which got my hopes up were being served to the student in front of me. That student turned to me and said, "Sorry, pal," but it didn't help. He could offer to share the baklava, each getting two pieces, but no. I fell into a sea of despair.
