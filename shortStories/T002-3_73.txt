It was mid-afternoon and the dog's barking was mixed with children screaming. Then came the angry swearing. I went outside to see what was going on: a father was trying to protect his kid while hitting the dog with a club. And animal lovers around were attacking the father for hitting the dog. I didn't know how to react. On one hand, there is a terrified kid who might never be able to create a bond with an animal, and on the other there is a dog which is in need of care and love. Then I realized that not only humans should have rights, but animals, too. And those rights must be preserved.
