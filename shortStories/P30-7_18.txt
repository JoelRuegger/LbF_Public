I went on Erasmus! My arrival at the residence in Leeds was a very positive psychological shock. I already had my new home for the upcoming months and I could not wait to meet my flatmates. I will not describe all those moments, because I know that I will never be able to do it in such a way that you could understand what I felt. "Only they who live it can feel it." Friendships happened naturally, my adaptation to the faculty was wonderful, and I was more than happy. Don't believe those who say that Erasmus is just a party, because, in my case, I studied more during that semester than I had studied during the previous two years. Of course, I also traveled a lot, tried new things and lived unforgettable adventures. I lived my Erasmus to the fullest. It is incredible that I was not homesick at any moment, neither did it occur to me to come back, and the only time I cried was precisely on my return flight: "We cry because we do not know when we will see each other again," they said. But that did not happen. We have already had a meeting in the Netherlands and we still talk on a daily basis. England made me feel the luckiest, happiest, bravest, freest, most determined, optimistic, and adventurous person in the world. England shaped me into the person I am today and it is the memories of that time that give me the strength I need to do everything I want.
