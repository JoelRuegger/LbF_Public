I love it when I'm at home on a summer evening and a violent thunderstorm starts suddenly. Outside it gets cold, wet and uncomfortable. Especially on weekends I take the thunderstorm as an occasion to treat myself to a few really cozy hours. I make myself a hot chocolate that fills the whole living room with a delicious smell. Then I push the comfortable armchair close to the window and muffle myself into a cuddly blanket. This way I can watch the storm outside safe and protected. From time to time, I sip my chocolate and feel how the pleasant sweetness spreads warmly in my body. When it gets dark, I light candles and listen to the sound of the rain. But it gets really heavenly when my cat decides not to hide from the thunder anymore and to share the cozy hours with me. When he rolls up on my lap, purring, I stroke his soft fur and enjoy life while the world outside is washed clean.
