Who loves the sun? Me, all my life, but as we know in the North, in Picardy the sun is not often there. As usual, before going to bed I looked at the weather: sunny with intermittent clouds and 25 degrees Celsius. After seeing this good news I went to my wardrobe and took out shorts, a floral t-shirt and a pair of sandals. After hanging my vest on my coat door I went to bed. I could finally close my eyes in tranquility, and dream of the day that would await me. Unfortunately, when I woke in the morning I had the bad surprise that it was raining and that we could not distinguish or even expect any rays of sun for the whole day. Therefore, annoyed, I had to go back to my wardrobe, store my clothes I took out the day before, to get out the warmest ones to face this day; I went out carrying an umbrella.
