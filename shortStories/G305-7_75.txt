Seeing Anette in this beautiful white dress makes my heart beat faster. I notice that my eyes are getting wet, blink the tears away and grin at the woman who is walking toward me to tie the knot with me. When Anette finally stands in front of me and takes my hand, a thousand lights shoot through my body and wake up the butterflies in my belly. They flutter and make my face shine even more. I am excited and have damp palms, but I don't care, because I will become the happiest man on Earth shortly. I only have eyes for Anette, who smiles at me and I only catch what the priest says in the background. Finally, we exchange our yesses and the rings. As soon as Anette breathes a "Yes, I do" to me, I can't stop my tears, I cry and laugh and cry and laugh. Passionately I take Anette into my arms, bend over her and give her a long kiss in which I put all my feelings and anticipation for our future together.
