At last I've done it! Two years after having finished high school with rather low marks, I thought I wasn't going to manage it. After having taken the university entrance exams twice, I had almost thrown in the towel. But the second time I managed to score higher marks in a section that I didn't think I could improve in, though even so I was still a few percentage points below the mark that I needed to get into university. However, these percentage points didn't turn out to be decisive, and the good news arrived. At last I had got into university! I remember receiving that message on my mobile phone telling me I'd been accepted onto the education course. Naturally, I've still got that message; I didn't want to delete it, and I still open it sometimes, just to remember that moment when I let out a yell of satisfaction. I am so happy to have finally achieved what I set out to do, and I know that I'm really going to enjoy the next four years. From now on, nothing's going to stop me!
