She wrote me a lot in the last few weeks. She told me how badly she is doing, what kind of pain she is in and that she can't work anymore because of it. I just met her. She was talking and couldn't stop. Her gaze was so restless, scurrying back and forth like a chased wounded animal. Now I am at home and my tears are running down my cheeks constantly. I try to calm down, inhale and exhale deeply again. It's unbelievable! I always knew. Now it's certainty. She was not the only one who had to live through all the horrible things. No, she was not the only one in this family who had to endure this pain and injury to body and soul. Two sisters also share her fate. It takes my breath away and I feel such an infinite pain in my chest! Inhale ... exhale ... don't let the emotional pain take its toll. Compassion, yes, but no pity, would it help her? But it's so unbelievable!
