As I sit down waiting for Sanna, I ask for two coffees. I cannot believe we are going to meet after all these years. We met on the Internet a couple of years ago because we had common interests, and now I cannot imagine my life without her. I have been euphoric since she told me that she was coming to Portugal to visit her maternal grandparents. We always talked about her coming here or about me going to Finland. And now it's finally happening. I see her coming forward and I cannot stop smiling. I go toward her and hug her. Seeing her without the barrier of a screen is just spectacular. Here she is, my best friend in the whole world and finally I can hug her. We talk nonstop about everything and nothing and it is so good that I cannot imagine having to interact with her again through technologies. I will miss her. I do not know how many times I have been warned not to talk to strangers online or have been told how absurd it is to make friends that are miles away when there are other people closer. But the truth is that spatial proximity does not mean compatibility. Sitting on the terrace, in the physical presence of one of the most important people in my life, I realize that, despite the vastness of the world we live in, certain people are destined to be part of our lives and, for me, Sanna is one of them.
