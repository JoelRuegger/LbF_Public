I had a day off and I decided to go out and take a walk in the woods. I didn't know the area, and I found an old building that seemed abandoned. As I entered the house, I felt like somebody was watching me. As I walked into a room I felt a chill, a distant silhouette was emerging through the only window, and I heard a humming sound that was gradually getting louder. As my stomach squeezed, a gust of wind snapped the door of a wardrobe. Next to it was a mirror, and with horror I saw that someone was standing behind me. Completely paralyzed, I watched him go through me, then disappear. When I was going home, I noticed that nobody answered my hellos or looked at me. As I went to bed, passing in front of my mirror, I had an intense sensation of uneasiness: the only reflection I saw was that of this someone that had just taken me from my existence, my own life.
