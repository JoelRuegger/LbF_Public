In my bubble. I can't hear anything around me except the voice of the referee and the coach. I'm feeling short of breath, exhausted, but I keep getting up, fighting to reach my goal. I hear my coach on the chair pushing me, giving me the solutions. I look at him desperately, I am led: he says nothing but I understand his look. I try to catch my breath, and at that moment I give all I have left. I hear him behind me, I hear the encouragement I had lacked up to that point. I hear the clock, the seconds passing by. I put everything into this last action, all my strength. And I hear that famous beep. End of time. I lie on the floor, my hands on my head, dejected. I realize that I have just missed the dream of my life. A podium that escapes me, a dream wiped out in four minutes. My coach knows my disappointment: I allow myself to let out tears of rage and hatred toward myself.
