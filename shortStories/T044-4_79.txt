I have three dogs and two cats. I and five animals are living in this house: it's not a big house but I haven't heard any complaints yet. I always liked animals and enjoy living with them. First I adopted a cat, then a dog, then the rest followed. The only thing I had a hard time getting used to is the pad pad sound at nights that comes from their paws when they walk on the hard floor. At nights there is always this sound: they get up to eat, play, go to the toilet, etc. One of them is always awake even though the others are sleeping. For many nights I stare at the ceiling wide awake waiting for all of them to fall asleep. Those moments are too rare and they pass too quickly: before I fall asleep, one of them wakes up. So, the only solution is getting used to this sound, and that's what I did. After years, lately I have been lying in bed awake listening to the sounds that are coming from outside my door. Like I said, these sounds won't bother me normally, but I have been living alone for some time and it bothers me.
