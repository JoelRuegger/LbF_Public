It was a cold day, I decided to walk around during the lunch break. I got far away from the conference hall. On my way back, the navigation on my phone suggested a shortcut. I started to follow this shortcut. The building I needed to reach is on the top of a hill: in order to reach it I need to pass through a wooded area and walk 200 to 300 meters. When I entered this wooded area, I realized100 meters away from me a dog was staring at me. I stopped immediately and continued to look at it: I didn't know what to do. Then the dog barked. Just one bark. Ten dogs jumped out behind it and started to run toward me. There was nobody around. I was terrified but couldn't escape. Before seconds had passed, they had reached me. I was looking at the one who was running in front. I swung my bag at it and yelled. It suddenly turned back and the others followed, I was surprised. They stopped only 10 meters away from me and started barking. I took a few steps backward then turned and ran away. I didn't know I could be this brave. My heart was pounding madly and I was all sweaty. I ran for a while. And will never trust my cell phone again.
