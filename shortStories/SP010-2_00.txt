Finally we decided it would be the best thing to do; there was no point in prolonging her suffering. The vet helped us with his comments. "You can be with her right up until the end; first we'll give her an injection that will send her to sleep, and then another one that will slow down the entire circulatory system until it causes cardiac arrest, which won't be at all painful or sudden. Sometimes we end up making our animals suffer for nothing, just because we want to try absolutely everything. But it's really not wise to become obsessed with complicated operations that offer no guarantees that the animal will have a decent quality of life afterwards. Obviously, you are the owners, although we prefer the term 'guardians' to 'owners'." The vet seemed to be completely sincere in what he was saying, and at no point did he try to increase his earnings from the situation. And so Xana, a lovely Labrador-retriever, was put to sleep on 15/12/2008 at the age of 12. She had cancer, and it was causing her a great deal of pain and discomfort.
