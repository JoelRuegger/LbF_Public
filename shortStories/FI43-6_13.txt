A couple of days ago, I bought a new computer game that has received really good reviews. I've been wanting to play it, and I finally managed to get a free night, which I dedicated to playing the game. I arrive home, change into comfortable clothes and relax in front of the computer. The computer starts up quickly, and I squint in front of the bright display. I download the game and go through the instructions on the controls. The game is fairly simple and easy to learn, and it doesn't take me long to get into the game. After a few minutes, I'm completely immersed in the game, concentrating so much on it that I don't see or hear anything else. I kept forgetting to check the time, which seems to fly by. I'm glad nobody interrupted my gaming so that I could become fully immersed.
