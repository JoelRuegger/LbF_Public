I have recently decided to spend my free time, during the week and even on weekends, doing volunteer work in an association near my house that helps and collects abandoned cats and dogs from the streets. I have always had a passion for animals and I feel like I have made the right choice. I knew the association needed volunteers, and I did not hesitate. I left the esplanade near the sea for the affection and unconditional love of these new friends, who make me as happy as or happier than when I am simply sitting in that chair. I am happy there, looking at the horizon, at the sea, and smelling it. I do not forget the sun, I like to feel it on my skin, but, if I am also happy while taking care of and pampering these beings, why shouldn't I share this emotion if both parties benefit from it? This was the thought that invaded me and made me change my routine. Now, whether it is just one or four hours, I make the most of it and concentrate on doing my tasks correctly. My love for this work grows day by day and I have never regretted this choice. On the contrary, it fills my heart and makes me feel useful and cherished.
