With a drink in my hand I'm sitting at the pool bar of my holiday hotel in the middle of Chiang-Mai, Thailand. I like watching my little daughter splashing in the water. Since she can swim well, she is allowed to go into the deep pool, which she obviously enjoys. Briefly, I turn my gaze away to look at my watch. When I want to dedicate myself to my daughter again, I am surprised to see her drifting flat on the water with her face down, completely motionless. My heart seems to stand still and my head knows only one thought: swimming accident! I can't think of anything better than calling her name immediately because I can't believe what I see. And the miracle happens: she lifts her head out of the water and asks, "Hello Daddy, what is it?" A weight drops off my chest and I ask, "What are you doing?" She answers, "You know, Daddy, I'm playing dead: I'm quite good at it."
