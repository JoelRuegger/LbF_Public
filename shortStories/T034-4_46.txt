Hi, my name is E. And this is my university story. For all my high school years, I felt I was 72% of myself in everything. In OSS, I won engineering with only 72% of my capacity. One of my biggest regrets was attending prep school. But if you have a successful dad and perform like a racing horse, all this becomes a dream. And there you go, I started university like another year of high school. First lateral transfer dream, after 2nd midterms double major dream, then after first finals double minor dream, finally after the first exams of second term just hoping to continue in my department, and after the second term struggling to stay away from summer school. Then come the friends, shisha, backgammon â€“ and hello, summer school. In the third year we met engineering lessons. And we got intimate in my 4th,5th,6th and 7th years. What can I do, one can't warm to those lessons easily. I'm E, and today it has been 7 years, 3 months, 2 weeks and 5 days since my graduation, I have been an engineer for 2,666 days, but all these 2,666 days, I have missed my school. I miss METU; I miss those days.
