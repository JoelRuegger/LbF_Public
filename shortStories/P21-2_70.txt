Throughout my life, things have become better and better. My mother and my father died while jumping from a plane because the parachutes did not work, and so I became the owner of the cork empire that belonged to them. I graduated in Management and I learned everything there was to know about running such a big business. And everything was (and still is) plain sailing. However, I felt I something was missing. A vocation. There was a gap in me that success and abundance could not fill. One day I went hunting. I went with one of my bodyguards to a forest he claimed to know well. The security guy was a fat, goofy guy, and I did not even know his name. When we lost a deer, we began to chase it and we ended up losing ourselves. We wandered for a long time but we remained lost. Luckily, we found a cave and we sheltered there. The cave was cold and damp. We still managed to gather enough wood to light a fire before nightfall. Later, I remembered that I had a can of beans in my bag and decided to go and get it. As I held the can in one hand and the knife in the other, I was struck by a sudden and impulsive desire to kill the security guard. I did so: I approached him furtively and I beheaded him from behind. I was Nero! I was Vlad! I was powerful! I had finally found myself!
