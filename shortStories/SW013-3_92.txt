The fear tastes of sour milk. Deceitfully, it attacks me, which is the last thing I need. My heart beats as fast as the wings of a hummingbird. Don't lose your courage! In my belly, a large lump forms and is rolled around by my nervousness. My hands are shaking, I have hot and cold flashes. My knees almost buckle, but I force them to keep standing. I'm ordering my body to move on. I command my eyes not to get stuck on you and go on with a smile on my lips. I obey myself. I ignore you. I noticed your sideways glance. You're jealous. I'm proud. I've managed to rise up from nobody, and now I can look down on you. You, of all people, the person who wore me down all my life. Laughed at me, side-lined me, excluded me. I confronted my tyrant. And you lost.
