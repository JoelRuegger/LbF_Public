It was during my time as a volunteer in a street children's project in Ghana. We were a handful of guardians who had many children to care for and all of them were very sweet in their own way. But one child was especially dear to my heart, a little girl of eight years old who always shouted enthusiastic rejoicings and almost crushed me with joy when she saw me entering the place in the morning. So I immediately noticed when one day she didn't come to the project anymore, and I decided to check on her. She lives in a small container with her grandmother, who had forbidden her to continue visiting the project, but after some back and forth I convinced her to send the girl back to us. The next day, when I entered the square, she was already standing there and looked at me embarrassed. I took her into my arms and she started to cry, never wanting to let go of me again and after a while she brought out a whimpering "thank you." I will never forget this simple "thank you" and the relentless radiance in her eyes when she saw me.
