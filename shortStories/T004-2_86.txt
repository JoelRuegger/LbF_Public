It was a long time ago: the death penalty was not yet abolished. A murder case. The lawyer at the court door told me, "Don't be scared, nothing is gonna happen, this case has nothing to do with you." I knew it too but couldn't help it: fear had already taken me under its control. I was shaking and I could barely stand. It is not easy, the smallest mistake can take one to death. I was there as a witness, the guilt (!) was already decided, everything was ready but still it was a risky situation. Life was at stake. Life, whoever it is, as long as they don't talk too much, is valuable. Whatever, they finally took us in, I'm still alive. The case was closed, I was saved and relieved. This relief lasted about a year. Until I saw this man in my dream, the one who couldn't stop talking. I mean the guy whose case I witnessed: the one got killed. The one I killed. If I knew this was gonna happen. But he left me no choice. I wish he could have stopped talking when I asked him to: now I have to listen to him every night.
