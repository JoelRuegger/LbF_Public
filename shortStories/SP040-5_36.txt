When I was a teenager, we used to spend our holidays on the coast. We would meet up with boys and girls who we played with, and sometimes we used to get into mischief. There was a seafront promenade with a little wall that must have been half a meter high, tall enough for us to hide behind if we crouched down low. In the evening, a tractor would turn up to clean the sand, dragging a piece of wood behind it that left the sand completely flat. Every so often, one of us naughty children would jump onto the wood and let ourselves be dragged along the beach. This really annoyed the tractor driver, because it was a bit dangerous, I suppose. But as we knew that it got on his nerves, one evening when there weren't many people on the promenade, we hid behind the wall and when the tractor passed by, we started frantically shouting: "Get off, Juan! Get off or he'll see you!" The good man slowed the tractor down and tried to see if there were any of us rascals hanging on to it. But finally, since he couldn't see anyone, and he could still hear us shouting, he stopped the tractor and got off to see what was going on. Unable to contain our laughter, we all ran away so he couldn't tell us off.
