I learned how to read before all my friends and that's why the teacher gave me a red ribbon. I couldn't wait to show it to my father. But my father was a cop and I couldn't see him for weeks. This time I wouldn't sleep and waited for my father until midnight to show my ribbon. I even tied it to my wrist. Hours passed, everyone was asleep but I was in the living room watching TV. I was struggling to stay awake, forcing my eyelids to stay open. I was beaten. When I opened my eyes, it was already morning. My father arrived but I fell asleep. I slapped myself out of my anger and ran to my parents' bedroom. It was the first hours of morning and they were still asleep, so I waited silently in front of their door. I took my father's cap and put it on my head. How big was my father's head! Finally, he woke up. Before I could show my ribbon to him he said something that hit me like a train: he said, "Look at how much this boy has grown up," like he was seeing me for the first time. He didn't see me when I was becoming me. I couldn't show my ribbon to this guy who saw me for the first time. I hid my hand behind me, untied the ribbon and hid it in my palm, then tossed it into the garbage.
