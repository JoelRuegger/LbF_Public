It was early August and there was a group of us friends traveling to Sicily. The airport was quite crowded, but we had gone there with time to spare, and we felt more like having a coffee than queuing up to check in. Even though we were sitting right in front of the check-in desks, and we saw that the queue wasn't moving, we weren't fazed at all, we were happy to be on holiday. An hour and a half before the flight was due to leave, we went to check in. But of course, the queue continued to crawl forward at the same speed. We never heard the famous 'Last call,' and half an hour before the plane was due to leave, we went to complain to the airline. The first thing they did was to tell us off for not keeping an eye on the time, the next was to tell us that we wouldn't be able to catch our flight, and we'd have to delay our departure for three days, which would mean we'd only have four days of vacation. We were all beset by anxiety, nervousness and hysteria, but we didn't give into the idea that all was lost. We asked for provisional tickets, we went through the security check with suitcases that were too large, containers more than 100ml in size and all kinds of sharp, pointed tools and objects. And thanks to everybody's patience and generosity, we finally managed to reach our destination.
