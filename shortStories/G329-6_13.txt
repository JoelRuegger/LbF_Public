I was sick, lying in bed with the flu, feeling weak, tired, and coughing my lungs out of my body. My friends were on vacation: I hadn't seen anyone in days. Then the doorbell rang. I was so tired and in my pajamas. I didn't want to get up, especially as the doorbell often rings when packages have to be delivered for my neighbors ... But the bell rang again, longer. So, I got up after all, but I was a bit annoyed, I mean, I was sick â€“ leave me alone! There was someone standing at the door with a large bouquet of flowers. I opened the door and tried to let her in, but she wanted to give me the flowers! I just said it couldn't be. But there was no confusion, there was even a card! Inside, I unpacked the flowers and they were the most beautiful flowers I could have imagined, red roses, wonderful roses. And a sweet card with a little insider joke that made me laugh. I was still sick, still coughing, but someone was thinking of me.
