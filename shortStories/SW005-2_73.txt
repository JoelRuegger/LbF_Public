I've known Emmi for years. She was in therapy with me for her walking difficulties. We developed a friendship. To me, she was a wise woman. Two months ago, I started treating her at home. When I visited her a couple of days ago, she was sleeping in a wheelchair. I had a strange feeling. As she woke up for a short moment, she was very confused and seemed to come to me from afar. I sat at her feet and intuitively massaged her swollen legs. There was something in the air. As I sat before her, the image of the last anointing came to me. That touched me very much. Tears ran down my cheeks. Emmi felt my tears and although she was fast asleep again, she mumbled, "Everything will be fine." I struggled with my grief when the family doctor came and confirmed my feelings. Emmi's blood tests are bad: her foot needs to be amputated. After a short period of reflection, Emmi decided against it, she was willing to die. Three weeks later she found peace, but her dying was still strenuous.
