The only problem we had with this new house that it was very far away from my mom and dad's school, where they were teachers, and my little brother's day care. I was ten years old and the first to get home. My parents left work together and picked up my brother on their way home. The time in between passed a little weirdly for me. From the moment I stepped into the house I started crying, thinking that they would have an accident and die. Different reasons each day: sometimes I cried about losing my brother, being alone, missing them, or if I was not too sentimental I cried about not having someone to knit me a sweater. I ran to the balcony immediately and watched the road. When I saw our blue car on the street, I'd be surprised and happy, and wash my face quickly so that they couldn't tell that I had cried. Every weekday for a year passed like this, then it was summer break again. One weekend morning, when I was not waiting, my parents left home to go to school for an examination duty. They had an accident on the way and got crushed by a truck with our blue car.
