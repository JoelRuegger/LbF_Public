It was my seventh day at the hospital. Nobody came to visit except my family. By family, I mean my poor mother and my cousin Fethi. If there was nobody to bring my mother she couldn't come either, anyway. My mother stayed for two days than complained about how sitting was making her pain worse. She wasn't wrong. She was very old and had many problems: rheumatism, sciatica, diabetics, tremors that come and won't go away for days. She is dragging her old body with legs that look like they are only there to complete the picture. When she started to complain about her pains again while looking at me wanting to leave, I sent her home pretending to insist on it. It was a very happy moment for Fethi. He wasn't happy about bringing my mother and spending hours at the hospital. He doesn't even like me. He was putting up with me for his aunt's sake. It's okay. I thanked him in a manner that fits our relationship and informed him that his visits were over. I can say that it was the moment he liked me most. I didn't talk to almost anyone at the hospital for 5 days. It wouldn't matter if I was at home anyway. There was nothing left to talk about there anymore.
